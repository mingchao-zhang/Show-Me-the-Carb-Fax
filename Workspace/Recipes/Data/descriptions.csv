5000012~This cake is perfect for beginners—it's moist, forgiving, and easy. Jif creamy peanut butter is our favorite for the decadent frosting.
5000013~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019323~Where a chutney and mustard sauce overlap. Choose a very ripe– even bruised–peach for easy peeling.
5000015~This uncooked soup isn't for the timid — raw garlic, ginger, and shallot impart strong flavors. Unless you can get freshly made vegetable juice from your local juice bar, you will need an electric juicer to make the tomato or carrot juice.
5000016~Classic spoon bread is a savory pudding served as a side dish. In this dessert version, the slightly sweetened batter is baked in individual ramekins, then topped with strawberry preserves.
5006976~Pork all over Denmark is hauntingly tender. Ruggiero was particularly taken with the pork belly she tasted at the restaurant Gammel Mønt—crisp, but succulent and rich. To re-create these qualities, Ruggiero devised a version that requires minimal effort but promises stunning results: Pork shoulder is braised first, until it's super tender, and then flash-seared for a golden crust. The aroma alone will convince you that this unorthodox technique is entirely worthwhile.

5000021~"Nashville: Try the ""fried"" chicken, y'all. Southern hospitality wouldn't be quite so hospitable without corn bread, collard greens, and, of course, fried chicken. If you haven't already guessed that grease is what's so ""finger-lickin' good,"" we'll let you in on a secret: You can spend nearly half a day's calories on one thigh of this Southern-fried favorite. So make our baked version instead."

We've adapted Mediterranean-food authority Paula Wolfert's quick method and made it even faster by blanching the lemons first. If you manage to find Meyer lemons, this is a great way to capture their unforgettable taste and perfume.
5000032~Don't be surprised if these spears prove even more popular than the classic mash—they brown up beautifully, and it's hard to resist the siren call of bacon.

5000052~I didn't think it was possible to love artichokes more than I already did until I lived in Italy. There they harvest artichokes in both spring and fall, and that abundance graces their cuisine. Artichokes also enhance their health, as they stimulate the gallbladder to produce bile, which escorts toxins out of the body and also helps break down fats in the diet. Here, artichoke hearts are combined with chicken, chickpeas, and olives to create a rich, nourishing stew, seasoned with a potpourri of heady and healthful spices, including turmeric, cumin, coriander, and mint. For a wonderful pairing, serve it over Brown Rice Pilaf with Saffron and Ginger .
5000053~Topping the chicken with pancetta slices before roasting adds a rich flavor.
5000054~Highly recommended!
5000055~This is a simple recipe that tends to impress. These elegant roulades are surprisingly easy to make and will get you a standing ovation at the dinner table. Take a bow, as you're giving everyone a nice dose of brain protection thanks to the vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin K, fiber, and phytonutrients found in the watercress and collards. If you can't locate fresh figs, swap in two thinly sliced ripe pears, and feel free to swap out the collards for kale.

5000063~Eastern Kentucky–born and –raised chef Colin Perry plies his art now in Montreal at Dinette Triple Crown. The food there taps into traditions of both the far north and the high country South, as in this delectably oh-so-sticky pudding. “I tend to use a lot of maple syrup in my cooking up here, because it’s so delicious and so accessible. But sometimes the taste of sorghum is the only taste that will do,” he says. Really fresh leaf lard has become more available in recent years from artisan butchers and specialty stores. If you can’t get real lard, then use butter. Shortening and grocery-store lard aren’t worth it.

5000080~Here is a jewel of an Afghani dish. Unusual and exotic, it is one I cook regularly, sometimes with shoulder of lamb instead of chicken thighs. I serve it with slow-cooked spinach, finished with leeks and a minuscule amount of rhubarb. This may sound strange, but the rhubarb is sweetened by the leeks and it really does work.
5000081~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5000082~Pipián Verde con Pollo
5000083~Yes, making this rice is a time commitment and a labor of love. But the ingredients aren't difficult to find, and the finished dish is stunning.
5000084~No one will fault you for seasoning brisket with salt and pepper, braising it in beer, and calling it a day. But follow chef Lee's method—which calls for a bath of stout, bourbon, and soy sauce; a glaze made with peach jam; and a side of easy homemade pickles if you'd like—and you're on the path to savory-and-sweet nirvana.
5000085~Constant basting with this lively sauce ensures moist chops and plenty of flavor. Warm potato salad with tarragon and white wine is the natural accompaniment.
5000086~"These dangerously addictive little bites fueled countless 1950s and '60s bridge parties from Greenwood Mississippi, to Greenville, South Carolina, before being rescued from recipe-box oblivion by modern Southern cooks like Martha Hall Foose. And thank goodness. Magic happens when a cracker slowly sops up the fat from smoky, crisping bacon; it transforms into something more akin to piecrust. Unadorned, bacon crackers are pure pork perfection. The addition of a tine bundle of rosemary needles makes for a fancified version, while topping the ""belt"" of bacon with a bit of brown sugar adds a hint of sweet to the smoke."
5000087~Sorghum is a gluten-free grain, with a texture similar to wheat berries, barley, and millet—so feel free to substitute those for this chicken recipe instead.

5000103~Shortening is the secret to extra-flaky pie crust, but nothing compares to the flavor of butter. Use both, as in this super-luxe beef pie, and you're golden.
5000104~"On a recent visit to London, Knauer overheard a local in a pub ordering a ""Guinness and Black"" — which turned out to be the famous Irish stout plus a shot of blackberry brandy. That combination is also the genius behind these floats; the brandy's luscious fruitiness bridges the gap between the sweet ice cream and bitter beer."
5000105~If you don't want to heat up your house with the oven, you can bake any muffins on the grill but the lightly smoky flavor that the grill imparts is especially nice with corn-based ones. Because keeping the grill at a steady temperature can be tricky, the baking time can vary, so keep an eye on the muffins. For the best muffins, be sure that the entire pan is not set over direct heat (otherwise, the bottoms will burn).

5000107~Glazed with a mix of hoisin, lime juice, and Sriracha sauce, duck confit happily travels from France to China. This exciting dish blends the fresh flavors of carrots, long beans, and herbs with slithery rice noodles and tender duck, its skin crisped under the broiler. When roasting the duck, be careful not to overcook it—you dont want it to dry out and become stringy.

The recipe makes more than enough lemon oil, but it stores well in the refrigerator and can be served with fish or used to flavor dips.
5000157~If you think mackerel is too fishy, this is the recipe that will change your mind. The fish's assertive, slightly oily character is tempered by the brightness of lemon juice and creamy richness of yogurt.

""He'd had a salad and was telling me all the components,"" says Acheson. ""It sounded wonderful, so I came up with my own version of it, using local ingredients from Georgia."""
5000177~I grew up outside Cleveland, Ohio, and the cassata is the cake of my childhood. This regional specialty is a great example of how recipes take on local styles over time. Some food historians believe the cassata has its roots in fourteenth-century Arab culture. In Sicily, the long-ago homeland of the immigrants who first brought it to America, the cassata often contains candied citrus fruits, citrus liqueurs, and a glazing of chocolate or almond marzipan.
5000178~These aren't sticky-sweet brown sugar baked beans. Think of them like the top crust of a good cassoulet.
5000179~Sweet summer corn is the best. You can make variations of the cilantro butter with different herbs and use lemon juice. If the corn isn't too sweet, add a little bit of maple syrup to the butter.

5000215~"This recipe is a wonderful way to celebrate the spoils of the Southern hunt, though it is just as delicious when made with farm-raised quail. If quail livers aren't included with the quail, chicken livers would be a good substitute. The size of a quail makes each bird a perfect individual portion for a dinner party. To make the stuffing, we've used another reward of the ""hunt"": wild mushrooms. When we forage in the woods near Summerland Farm, the mushrooms we most often find are chanterelles and hen-of-the-woods, especially prolific during a moist season. If you are foraging, be absolutely sure you know what you are looking for, as poisonous varieties can sometimes look dangerously similar to edible ones. To be on the safe side, visit a gourmet market or natural foods grocery store for a nice choice of mushrooms. We serve the quail on a bed of Wilted Autumn Greens."

And, because the torte must be made ahead and weighted (to release excess liquid), it's ideal for entertaining. Serve it with anything grilled (fish, chicken, or lamb, for instance) and your guests will be over the moon.
5000227~"""At the Manhattan law office where I'm a legal secretary, it seems as though the phones are always ringing,"" writes Lisa Caiazzo of Franklin Square, New York. ""And if it isn't the phones that have me occupied, then there are lots of documents that need my attention. By the time I get home from the city, I usually have only about 45 minutes to put together dinner for my husband, Angelo, and myself. Still, that's enough time to make something filling and delicious, like a salad and a hearty pasta or soup. My best cooking, though, is done on Sundays during the fall and winter, when I become a football widow. An afternoon of cooking can be very therapeutic after a busy week."""
5000228~As the pork cooks, the fat will gradually render, basting the roast.

5000230~"Shullie Neumark of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, writes: ""I like cooking but I'm a little bit impatient, which is why I make dishes that can be done ahead of time — and quickly. I hate being rushed before meals, especially when guests are on their way over. Those guests are usually good friends or members of our large family. Often I'll prepare some of the Russian and Lithuanian recipes passed down from my relatives."""
5019832~We love mashed potatoes in every way possible, but we're extremely partial to this incarnation paired with cauliflower. Since cheese is a natural with both potatoes and cauliflower, incorporating a little Fontina and parmesan into the purée adds a nutty goodness, without overpowering it with richness.

5000233~The first time my parents came to Rialto, site of my first pastry chef gig, my mom laughed out loud when she saw the dessert menu. Every dessert featured ice cream, and one dessert had two. My dad and I are both complete ice creamaholics, and once I was in a position to make my own ice creams, they showed up everywhere I could put them! I made fruit ice creams, nut ice creams, spiced ice creams. You name the ingredient and I made it into an ice cream. This was one of my favorites. Originally it was a honey-vanilla ice cream, but this variation popped up one day when my vanilla supplier missed a shipment. Needing to make a quick ice cream base for that evening's service and stuck without vanilla beans, I turned to the spice larder, selected a few cinnamon sticks, and a new flavor was born. I like the way the warm cinnamon flavor melds with the natural earthiness and roundness of the honey. An added plus is that honey is a sweetener that lends itself to extra-creamy ice creams, which you'll notice immediately when you taste this one after churning.
5000234~Goat cheese and mint make for a special springtime version of bruschetta. Serve these on a platter as an appetizer, or offer them alongside the Radicchio Salad .

5000246~This is a good option for cold-weather Thanksgivings eaten under threatening skies, since the combination of herbs and citrus provides a house-filling aroma that speaks to sunniness.

5000256~This easy slurry method takes polenta into weekday fare. And this recipe shows how to make a deeply flavored mushroom sauce with the simple addition of dried porcini. Both techniques are in my go-to repertoire.
5000257~Even though they are most often associated with the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, potato pancakes have a year-round appeal. Here they are given a Middle Eastern twist with the addition of flour made from chick-peas - the dominant flavor in falafel - as well as chilis, herbs and spices. Pour a dry white wine. For dessert, present fruit and some halvah. Chick-pea flour is available at Middle Eastern and Indian markets.

5000270~Briny feta is pickled, then tossed with plump olives and strawberries for a bright, juicy salad. Since the feta needs five days to cure in the fridge, this is a great make-ahead dish. Use Greek feta if you want neat cubes; Bulgarian feta is divine, but it needs to be handled carefully as it's very soft and crumbly. Whip up this recipe for a picnic, or serve it after a day on the beach when salt and sun are still on everyone's mind. Glasses of Prosecco or Saison are a perfect accompaniment.
5000271~Breakfast bowls are the new green juice: they've become an in-demand menu item for the post-yoga, post-spin class set, despite some eyebrow raising prices for what boils down to a pretty simple breakfast. Why spend all of that money on something you can easily make at home? This hearty, gluten-free bowl takes just minutes to throw together and is absolutely delicious.
5000272~This recipe calls for two small roasts instead of one big one. They are easier to cook, and make for prettier slices.
5000273~Based on the classic pâté à choux or cream puff pastry from my culinary school days, this elegant and easy appetizer can be made ahead. It can be prepared dairy-free, too, but egg substitutes won't work as the eggs are necessary to help create the structure of these bite-size treats.

5000277~This frozen treat is low in calories and fat. You can top it with mango and crystallized ginger, if desired. If freezing overnight, thaw briefly in the microwave, stopping to stir, or let the frozen yogurt stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving.
5000278~Pinhead oats, which are similar to steel-cut oats but contain some oats that are ground finer, like flour, make a foolproof crunchy-crisp gluten-free crust for pan-fried fish. You can exchange the catfish for just about any common white fish here—use a lower heat level under the pan and a longer cooking time for thicker fillets. Some good options include U.S. farmed tilapia, ocean perch, Pacific halibut, and line-caught Atlantic cod. Wild salmon would also be delicious—just be sure to avoid overcooking it.

5000296~This is one of my favorite soups. It has to be served really cold so that you can appreciate the buttermilk and yogurt tang and the sharpness they add to the cucumbers. The Tabasco is optional, but I recommend it to give a little kick at the end; it won't register as spicy, but you'll miss it if it's not there.

5002764~"The technique: When it comes to poultry, butterflying means removing the backbone and flattening the bird like a book. This is easy enough to do with a chicken, but we suggest asking your butcher to butterfly the turkey.
The payoff: A flattened turkey cooks more evenly and quickly than a regular bird. Tucking the stuffing under the skin ensures that the meat will be moist and delicious.

5000329~"""Wonderful!"" was the comment scribbled in the margin of this recipe when my friend and colleague, Donna Adams, tested it. The dish improves if prepared ahead of time and reheated. The pork freezes very well, but the pineapple does not, so add the fruit just before serving. You must use fresh pineapple, as the acidity of the fresh fruit provides the balance needed in the sauce.

I really like it to have a powerful note. It is another terrific dish for entertaining as the rice, basil, and tomatoes can all be made in advance. The rice can be kept warm over hot water or it can be reheated in a microwave. The lobster can be cut up in advance, and then all that is left to do is to put it all together, which should take no more than twenty minutes.

5000378~Room temperature ingredients make all the difference in this cake. You can get more loft from non-chilled egg whites, and room-temperature butter is easier to cream (beat together) with sugar than the straight- from-the-fridge stuff. The fluffy egg whites and properly creamed butter and sugar mean tender, light cake. And room-temp butter and cream cheese will translate to creamy, smooth frosting instead of a sticky mess filled with lumps.

5000394~Executive food editor Kemp Minifie brought the idea for this restorative pasta from her own home. Everyone in the test kitchen loved the briny intensity of feta and olives offset by sweet currants and slightly bitter chard. The garlic doesnt stay crisp for long, so be sure to serve immediately.
5000395~Besides the tacos, try the Pico de Gallo on scrambled eggs, grilled chicken or instead of sour cream on a baked potato.
5000396~A chocolaty version of a rich French gâteau called, aptly, a financier, this cake shows how ground nuts, melted chocolate, butter, and beaten egg whites can result in a deceptively light texture.

5000412~This is a tiki drink disguised as an old-fashioned, so it's no surprise that it comes from Brian Miller, Death & Co's resident scalawag and expert on all things Polynesian. One night a waitress asked Brian to make something stirred and boozy, so he took one of tiki's core principles—blending several base spirits to create a new flavor profile—and applied it to whiskey and brandy. It was another breakthrough moment for the bar, and these days it's not unusual to find two or more base spirits in our drinks.
5000413~Rich, aromatic rouille is a classic lily-gilding for French fish soups; this one has an extra something special: saffron. Even if you love saffron, though, don't be tempted to add any extra threads. This is just the right amount to really flatter, not dominate, the soup.
5000414~Pastry chef Jennifer Jones of Topolobampo in Chicago shared this recipe as part of a Cinco de Mayo feature on Mexican desserts. Jones encourages you to use different fruits in this refreshing dessert, but recommends sticking to ones that are sweet but have acidity. Raspberries are a perfect example.
5000415~This is like pouring a cooked mojito over stewed chicken, with the rum, lime, and herbs mingling beautifully with the chicken juices. Serve it with rice and a cold, crispy Alsatian white like a Pinot Blanc.
5000416~It looks like a Japanese roll—but it's not! Green beans stand in for the traditional scallion; thin slices of prosciutto replace beef.
5019101~The yogurt helps tenderize the chicken; the garlic, ginger, and spices in the marinade infuse it with lots of flavor.
5000418~The Ginger Fried Rice with Shiitake Mushrooms is a perfect side dish for this salmon.
5019275~This rustic cake gets a zing from a tangy lemon glaze. The sauce dresses up the cake for dessert (or brunch).
5007137~The concept of ground almonds and extra-virgin olive oil in a cake may sound like a recipe for a lead weight, but this dessert is surprisingly airy and light yet also amazingly moist. And the bonus of a jigger of Amaretto liqueur can only make it better.

5000428~A silky, herby vinaigrette brings together fresh eggs and peak-season vegetables.
5000429~Fresh horseradish can have very intense flavor and heat, which is why we start with a small amount — taste the sauce and add more only if desired.
5010458~Tacos have been part of Mexico's culinary heritage for well over a hundred years. These folded tortillas can be stuffed with any number of fillings—with each Mexican state claiming stake to their own. Fish tacos are said to come from Baja California, Mexico's northernmost state. While the original fish taco was made with deep-fried fish, this recipe—made with sautéed fish—is a delicious and fresh version. This recipe is easily doubled, which makes it a great dish to make when entertaining a crowd.

5000439~"Panna cotta means ""cooked cream"" in Italian, and, indeed, that is just about all these elegant little desserts consist of. A touch of hazelnut liqueur and a rustic sauce of crushed berries make this version just right for romantic company."
5000440~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional sitting time.
5000441~Nonfat yogurt and low-fat mayonnaise provide a creamy base for this dipping sauce for the artichokes. It's also great with asparagus, as well as with grilled tuna, salmon, chicken or flank steak. Begin making the sauce the day before serving since the yogurt needs to drain overnight.

For more than two decades, Cecylia Roznowska, a Polish-born dancer and choreographer, has been leading wedding dances and twirling Polish-American couples in a polonaise toward happily-ever-after. Since immigrating to Chicago in 1984, she is the founder and artistic director of the Northwest Center of Traditional Polish Dancing and the Polonia Ensemble, a youth folk dance company that performs at celebrations, festivals, parades, and—of course—weddings.

5000452~This beautifully simple, light curry is closely based on a wonderful recipe from chef Angela Hartnett. It's always preferable to use some carefully selected ground and whole spices in a recipe like this, but if you're in a hurry, use a ready-made curry powder instead of the dry spices.

5000454~"Carol Gilbert of Saratoga, California, writes: ""I've been working full-time since my daughter was in high school, but it took about ten years to get over the notion that I should be cooking everything — the way my mother did — and climb the corporate ladder. There's simply not enough time. I finally realized I didn't have to make everything from scratch; now I give myself permission to buy a dessert or a salad dressing if I need to."""

5000457~This dish is an excellent accompaniment to almost any Mexican meal. The beans should be whole, perfectly tender, and swimming in a generous amount of broth.
5000458~This dressing is served on the side with Junior's Reuben sandwiches. It's so good that you'll find many other foods it matches up perfectly with, like sliced roasted turkey or chicken salad, a cold poached salmon salad, cold roast beef, or a fresh tomato salad.
5000459~The iconic chocolate bar of peanut-studded caramel and nougat is all about chewiness. Transforming that small bite into a giant layered treat means keeping the same flavors, but whipping up nougat fluffy enough to eat by the forkful with soft peanut-studded caramel.

5010434~Instead of Panela, other soft white Mexican cheeses — such as Oaxaca, or those used for making quesadillas — work well in this recipe. If none is available, substitute Monterey Jack cheese. The stuffed chilies can be assembled one day before baking. What to drink: A Napa or New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (or any dry but fruity white wine).
5000472~Most veggie burgers must have self-esteem issues, since they're always pretending to be something they're not. But these bulgur burgers don't try to hide their meatless nature and instead celebrate their grain-centric origins with wonderful texture and a hint of Middle Eastern spice.
5000473~Boiling the vinegar concentrates and sweetens it, so the dressing doesn't require as much oil to balance the acid.
5017459~To cut down on prep time, use cooked lobster meat, available in some fish markets and supermarkets, or follow the directions below for cooking frozen lobster tails.
5000475~"""I literally didn't know how to boil an egg until I was in my 20's — when I tried to impress a guy by making dinner for him,"" writes Sally Siegel of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""I didn't have much success with the dinner or the guy, but I regrouped and put together a repertoire of fairly elegant dishes I felt confident making. Over the years, my cooking style has become more casual; I make dishes that are not too demanding, but still special for company."""
5005687~Healers have touted saffron's medicinal properties since the days of Hippocrates, and Cleopatra claimed that it was an aphrodisiac. Its scarcity (it takes some four thousand crocus blossoms to create an ounce of saffron) and the belief that it could be used to treat everything from wounds to the plague even caused the Austrians to go to war over the spice during the Dark Ages. This is at least one feudal folk myth that modern science has corroborated. Studies have shown that saffron has outstanding antibacterial and antiviral properties and also aids digestion. People sometimes balk at saffron's cost, but it isn't unreasonable when you consider its potency; this recipe calls for only 1/8 teaspoon, and as you'll see, a little goes a long way. This pilaf is a delightful and gorgeous dish. The rice is sautéed before cooking to avoid that sticky, gummy consistency, and ginger, parsley, and lemon zest add zing.
5000477~"Coffee cakes rank among the most popular of comfort foods, welcomed at breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and as the name indicates, coffee breaks. A coffee cake batter is generally more liquid than a quick bread one and contains a bit more sugar, and as a result, the final product is lighter and moister. On the other hand, coffee cakes tend to be less sweet than butter cakes. There are many versions of kuchen, this streusel-topped sour cream type being a very popular one. It is commonly served at the meal following Yom Kippur, or Shavuot, and on Sabbath afternoons or the melaveh malcha (""accompanying the queen"") party following the Sabbath. For the later occasion, spices are added to the batter and topping, reflecting those used during the havdallah ceremony signaling the end of the Sabbath."
5000478~From the Café Iguana restaurant, in Denver, Colorado.
5000479~Serve at room temperature with a sprinkling of salt, cornichons, Dijon, and a baguette.
5000480~These root vegetable pancakes are a gift to eggs everywhere for brunch, served under a little crème fraîche and smoked salmon for a party app, or simply paired with sour cream and applesauce for an ideal sweet-savory combo anytime.
5000481~This is great with polenta or egg noodles. To peel the onions like a pro, boil them for one minute; drain, cool, and peel. What to drink: Mas de Guiot 2005 Château Guiot Rosé from France ($10), a vibrantly colored rosé with raspberry aromas and a hint of spice.
5000482~With a crisp outer shell of chocolate and a gooey marshmallow interior, these eggs are an Easter-basket favorite. If we have any left after Easter, I like to pop one of them on top of a mug of hot chocolate for a special treat. You can either decorate the eggs with chocolate, or you can simply dip the entire egg in tempered chocolate. If dipping, you will need to temper about 1 pound of chocolate to cover all the eggs. Then, working with 1 egg at a time, place it on a dipping fork, dip the entire egg in the chocolate, and then lift it out, allowing the excess chocolate to drip off. I prefer bittersweet, but milk or white chocolate will also work. You will need plastic or polycarbonate egg molds with each side forming half an egg that, when filled, clip together to make perfectly shaped eggs. They are available at most candy- and cake-supply stores.
5000483~Easily made with puff pastry, these light, thin apple tarts provide just the right amount of dessert. The skins get added to the syrupy glaze, enhancing the tarts with a bit of sweetness and the faintest blush of pink.
5000484~This elegant dish from Tony's in St. Louis, Missouri, is perfect for a small dinner party. At the restaurant, they serve it with sautéed spinach.

5000486~As a harbinger of spring, artichokes have a special place on the Passover table and in our hearts. One of Roberts's favorite ways to enjoy them is this elegant Roman preparation. (Rome is home to the oldest Jewish community in the Western worldthe first Jews arrived in 161 b.c.e. as ambassadors from Judah Maccabee in Jerusalem.) The trimmed artichokes are braised in a lemony broth zinging with garlic and mint, which is later reduced to a satiny sauce.
5000487~As this recipe proves, barbecue isn't just about the meat. Veggies taste even better when they're grilled. Add some crumbled Maytag blue cheese and a bright dressing for a meal that even a carnivore could love.
5000488~This salad was inspired by a couple of dishes our food editors encountered at restaurants in Rome.

5000501~As culinary director for Balducci's, Katy Sparks brought take-out food to a whole new level. Instead of the typical fried chicken and heavy potato salad, the market offers horseradish-crusted salmon and grilled fingerling potatoes with lemon. In this recipe she's taken the often-bland turkey burger to a higher plane, with the addition of tamarind.

5000503~No Korean meal is complete without kimchi, a piquant condiment of fermented vegetables (most popularly cabbage) seasoned with ginger, garlic, chile, and all manner of fresh or preserved seafood. Fermenting the ingredients over several days gives the dish its distinctive tang, but this easy version, which takes advantage of the funky depth of Asian fish sauce, offers relatively instant gratification.

Two, church was canceled (Church? Canceled? I don't understand.) and I didn't have anything else to do. Three, I was hungry, man.
5000513~No nduja? Just add an extra glug of olive oil along with some red pepper flakes.
5000514~"Home turf: New Mexico
Local flavor: Southwestern-style chili is all about the chiles (with an ""e""), as in this pillar of regional cooking, chile verde. The chiles are green and mild (New Mexico's famous hatch chiles are perfect), and the meat is pork. Tangy tomatillos balance the chiles and coat the slow-cooked pork. To up the regional cred, serve it ""Christmas"" style—with a combo of green and red chiles.
Make it a meal: Serve with warm corn tortillas, avocado and spinach salad with honey-lime vinaigrette, and a dark beer like Negra Modelo (Mexico, $8 per six-pack)."

5000535~"Although Nelly Custis omitted sugar in her recipe for these lovely, delicate pancakes, published cookbooks of the period often suggested ""strewing"" sugar over them before sending them to the table. E. Smith, for one, additionally recommended garnishing them with orange, a suggestion also included here. This recipe can be readily doubled."
5000536~This gluten-free cake makes a stunning end to a Passover meal or any springtime dinner, with surprisingly bright layers of green pistachio cake and pink strawberry meringue.
5000537~A quintessential Polish comfort food, pierogies can be stuffed with potatoes, cheese, sauerkraut, or wild mushrooms. Here, dried porcini are combined with cremini mushrooms, adding a woodsy depth to the filling. Served with golden sautéed onions and sour cream, these dumplings make a delicious main dish.
5000538~Oven-roasting whole fish marries ease of preparation with stunning presentation.
5018531~Sofrito is a sautéed vegetable mixture used as a seasoning in much of Latin America and the Caribbean. It typically contains garlic, onion, bell pepper, coriander, and sometimes tomatoes or ham, although the recipe varies among countries. In our version, we've omitted the oil normally used to cook the ingredients and instead simply puréed the vegetables.
5000540~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5013118~Blue Lake is a stringless variety found at farmers' markets and specialty foods stores. Others work well, too, as long as they're fresh and tender.
5000542~This side dish is like the love child of a salad and a pickle. Make it ahead of time and serve it at room temperature with the Steak and Olives
5000543~Improv: Try other meaty fish fillets such as halibut, swordfish, or tuna. Replace mixed herbs with mesclun.
5000544~Lamb is traditionally served at Easter in Italy as well as many other countries. Although author Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez grew up with the roasted legs of lamb prepared by her mother and grandmother, she prefers to braise a lamb shoulder. The meat turns out so tender and succulent that it's impossible to slice with a carving knife. Instead, it's pulled with a meat fork into moist, rich chunks. Depending on where you live, lamb shoulder may require a special order so be sure to allow time for a butcher to request it.
5000545~This raw dish is all about the best ingredients you can find. A great goat cheese and a fruity, high-quality olive oil will result in flavor that's as stunning as the presentation.
5000546~Traditional shawarma calls for roasting meat on a large vertical spit. We mimic the effect here by roasting at a high temperature, which yields chicken that is crisp on the outside yet moist and juicy on the inside.

5000555~Fermented black beans should be in everyone's pantry—they complement just about any protein and they can be turned into a sauce in no time at all. They are actually small black soy beans preserved in salt. You have to soak them to eliminate some of that salt, but then they are good to go. This sauce would go great not only with salmon, but on top of chicken, shrimp, tofu, or stir-fried vegetables. Serve with Butter-steamed Broccoli with Soy and Simple Boiled Rice.
5000556~"For this patriotic-themed cooler, Cabell Tomlinson combines two summer favorites: sweet iced tea and sangria. ""I started thinking about the Fourth of July,"" she explains. ""I had the red from the rosé and the blue from the blueberries. I still needed the white, but I decided to go with that oh-so-American spirit, bourbon."" She uses orange pekoe for the tea and suggests a fruity rosé like a Spanish Rioja."
5000557~The zing of fresh lemon enhances both the peas' sweetness and the natural flavor of the spinach. The whole quick, creamy dish is bolstered by soft pillows of potato gnocchi.

5000565~The delicate flavor of rice vinegar along with the other Asian ingredients in this vinaigrette is ideal on tender greens like mizuna or mâche
5000566~If you spend evenings camped out on your sofa staring at the boob tube, take note: People who spend four hours or more in front of the TV are twice as likely to be overweight as those who watch less than an hour a day, a new study from Australia reports. Study participants' body-mass index (which measures how much of your weight is fat) increased for every hour of TV time. If you watch two hours a day, you're 57 percent more likely to be overweight than those who keep tube time to an hour or less; if you watch three or more hours, you're 91 percent more likely to be overweight. What's worse, past studies show that this pastime triggers the munchies for high-fat snacks, though researchers aren't sure why. If you must gaze at the box, channel your snack urges toward something healthful, like this creamy, low-fat dip.
5000567~We like to bake with a combination of apples: some sweet and some tart, some that keep their shape and others that will break down and get saucy. Adding the pear lends a perfumey quality to the cake.
5000568~One of many cool things about (super-nutritious) sprouted lentils: They don't need to be cooked first.
5000569~Deep-frying a turkey is easier than you might think, plus it frees up oven space for the rest of your Thanksgiving feast, and takes less than 2 hours from start to finish. For a complete guide to the process, see our step-by-step slideshow, How to Deep-Fry a Turkey.

5000596~A first course with a serious wow factor. Even though this terrine is labor-intensive, it's not as fussy and last-minute as quenelles, and its ethereal texture rivals theirs. The salmon roe adds sparkle and zing both on the plate and on the palate, but if you want to take the terrine in a slightly different direction, use a small dice of blanched, peeled carrot in its place. You'll get a delicate crunch instead of a briny pop in the mouth.

Just roll the dough into balls between your palms, then coat them with decorative coarse sugars. This is the perfect cookie for children starting out in the kitchen, by the way. They'll have loads of fun mixing up different colors of the sanding sugar, and messy kitchen aside, everyone will be happy when they sink their teeth into the first ones warm from the oven.

5000622~All the vibrant, sun-drenched brilliance of the tropics is captured in this salsa that evolves in your mouth—first sweet, then hot. Luscious ripe pineapple is a perfect partner to the fiery, fragrant habanero chile. Not only is the habanero the hottest chile readily available fresh, when cut open it releases an intense perfume of ripe tropical fruits—mango, pineapple, citrus. As a finishing touch, a squeeze of fresh lime adds a pop of flavor and brightens the sometimes cloying sweetness of a really ripe pineapple. This salsa pairs well with dishes that are tropical in origin or spirit, that have bright, fresh flavors, or that have been simply marinated or grilled, whether fish or meat. It’s delicious with almost all fish and seafood tacos and grilled chicken dishes. If you cannot find fresh habaneros, substitute one tablespoon of a fruity hot or extra-hot habanero sauce with a mango base (Melinda’s makes a good one) for the habanero chile.
5000623~"This cowboy-style ""bowl of red"" is all about tender chunks of beef chuck and a five-chile-pepper purée. True to Texas tradition, it has no tomatoes and no beans. The heat is customizable to your taste, and don't skip the masa harina: It helps to thicken the chili and imparts a wonderful earthy richness. This chili is best served a day after cooking."
5017049~Start with a large platter.
5000625~This vegetarian starter has an incredibly silky texture, but less than a tablespoon of butter per serving.
5000626~"Lane Crowther, A contributing editor at Bon Appétit, says that ""For twenty-five years our family endured side dishes of canned creamed corn and sweetened baked squash—simply for the sake of tradition. With this soup, I was finally able to convince everyone that a few classic Thanksgiving ingredients (like corn and squash) could be combined in a delicious new way."""
5000627~Highly recommended!
5006025~The aspic will be a deeper shade of red if made with canned tomatoes (see cooks' note, below), but fresh tomatoes will yield a brighter flavor.

5000632~"When you want to put on the ""dog"" but not the fat, try this colorful salad."
5000633~I’m just going to say it: this is the best macaroni cheese I’ve ever eaten – better than the macaroni cheese I ate as a child; better than the macaroni cheese I brought my own children up on when they were little (they don’t agree); better than any fancy restaurant macaroni cheese with white truffle or lobster; better than any macaroni cheese I have loved in my life thus far, and there have been many.
5004060~This time-honored example of kitchen thrift is ready when you are: Have it simmering away while you tend to another meal or are puttering around on a Saturday morning. Just looking at it in the refrigerator or freezer will make you happy, secure in the knowledge that you can put a terrific meal on the table in no time at all.
5000635~Hand off this dough to the kids—or anyone with questionable baking skills—and let them go to town. Thumbprints can be any shape or size, and the fillings are customizable.
5000636~Epicurious asked chef Tom Colicchio for this recipe from 'Wichcraft, the sandwich shop in his growing collection of Craft restaurants. It's the perfect way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey — and a good excuse to roast a turkey any time of year. To create those leftovers, try Tom Colicchio's Herb-Butter Turkey.
5000637~Here's a classic Irish combination.
5015320~What to drink: Fess Parker 2000 Late Harvest Muscat Canelli, Santa Barbara County, or another sweet dessert wine with orange and honey flavors.
5000639~A whiskey-spiked variation on classic pecan pie. Serve the tartlets with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired.
5004852~The crunchy honey-almond praline pieces in the ice cream are an easy, homemade version of turrón, a popular Spanish candy.

5000642~(Thai Eggplant Salad)
5000643~I encourage rolling up your sleeves and using your hands to mix these spices—it helps to capture a feeling of nostalgia for cooking.
5000644~These plums nicely complement pork or lamb chops. You can slip off the skins before eating if you like.
5000645~Baked eggs are great for brunch, and this version is no exception. But with a salad of leafy greens, it's also hearty and satisfying enough to double as dinner.
5000646~This chicken is delicious over rice or pasta, which absorbs the tangy sauce. A salad and some crusty French bread would be fine accompaniments.
5000647~Highly recommended!
5000648~Here's a great breakfast or after-workout cooler that's ready in seconds and tastes as good as one you'd get at a juice bar.
5000649~Halved grapefruits taste delicious with a kiss of smoke from the grill. But they're even better sliced to expose more of the fruit to the caramelizing fire. Pomegranate molasses, with its sweet-tart flavor and syrupy texture, makes a tasty, ruby-hued glaze. Try this recipe with oro blanco (a white-fleshed pomelo), too. If you have fresh pomegranates, scatter the seeds over the top.
5000650~Pleasantly pungent and sweetened to taste with honey, this tea soothes and refreshes after a big meal. (We also like to brew a pot any time we feel a little under the weather.) Nibbling on the pine nuts as you sip the hot tea helps soften its strong flavors.
5005761~Highly recommended!
5017885~The brittle is a great gift on its own.
5000653~For centuries, southerners have enjoyed peanuts raw, baked, roasted and boiled, and in peanut butter, peanut brittle and even peanut soup. These roasted peanuts have a rich, smoky flavor that makes them good accompaniment to cocktails.

5000655~This decadent cake is infused with rich coffee flavor in three forms: brewed coffee, espresso powder, and coffee liqueur.
5000656~Chili powder and chopped jalapeño add a touch of heat to this smooth appetizer. Try sprinkling it with chopped red onion for some crunch and color.

5000666~Elena slow-cooks her polenta the traditional way, which can be a soul-satisfying experience if you set aside the time. When polenta is cooked properly, each grain of cornmeal slowly absorbs the liquid until it swells, becoming perfectly tender and seeming to disappear within the whole.
5000667~This weeknight falafel dinner brings the Middle Eastern platter home with a tangy, orange-spiked tahini sauce, bright quick-pickled red onions, and an easy green cabbage and tomato salad. Serve it with prepared hummus and pita for a more filling meal.

5000673~Mahimahi has a large, moist, and pleasantly firm flake. Topping it with briny feta, herbs, and lemon slices evokes the warm shores of Greece.
5000674~Al Forno restaurant put Providence on the culinary map, and grilled pizza-invented there by chef George Germon had a lot to do with it. Here's one to make at home.
5000675~"""My cousin and I had a delicious chocolate cake at Watershed, a restaurant in nearby Decatur,"" writes Joyce Jue of Atlanta, Georgia. ""I'd appreciate your getting the recipe so I can learn to make it."""
5000676~"Chile ""poppers""—just pop 'em in your mouth—are on many restaurant menus, and they're easy to prepare in your own backyard. They need to smoke at a higher temperature so the bacon wrapped around the outside of the chile gets cooked through. Although higher-heat smoking is technically not considered low-and-slow traditional barbecue, it does have its place in recipes like this one (and for people who use a ceramic smoker, which automatically smokes at a higher temperature). At a lower temperature, the bacon won't crisp up. You can also use this technique to smoke other bacon-wrapped appetizers like shrimp, water chestnuts, or green bean bundles. If you like, substitute goat cheese, garlic-and-herb cream cheese, or even pimiento cheese spread for the cream cheese and cheddar. You can also use almonds or walnuts instead of the pecans, or omit the nuts."
5000677~This stunning bread gets its branch-like form by taking a shaping cue from the classic French baguette bread, Pain d'Epi (a.k.a. wheat stalk bread). Use sharp scissors to cut the dough and gently move each piece to the side to keep the rolled filling as tight as possible.
5000678~(Spinaci con Pinoli e Passerine)
5000679~Highly recommended!
5000680~Orzo is the Italian word for barley, and the slender, grain-shape of orzo pasta makes for a no-fuss, neatly consumed salad, particularly if you are balancing a plate while perched on the edge of a sofa or standing around the TV watching the Super Bowl. Although the salad makes for a great accompaniment to the Stuffed Sliders Your Way, your vegetarian friends will thank you for providing them with an option they will really enjoy as their main dish.
5000681~Relish each step of preparing coffee- and chile-braised short ribs: Searing a brown crust on the ribs before they bake adds a deep caramelized flavor; sautéing the aromatics (onions, peppers, garlic) in the drippings makes the sauce base really fragrant.
5000682~The three main elements in this recipe make an unbeatable combination. The soft, sweet taste of the lamb coupled with full green flavor of the spinach and the nutty, full-bodied taste of the lentils makes every bite a gastronomic pleasure. These lentils are one of my favorites. I've interpreted a recipe from the masterful chef Judy Rodgers of San Francisco's Zuni Café.
5000806~"The word chutney comes from the Hindustani chatni, which means ""strong spices."" The sweet juiciness of golden pineapples — much more intensely flavored than ordinary pineapples — balances the spices with the lusciousness that only tropical foods possess. But you can substitute regular pineapple if you cannot find the golden variety, and the chutney will still be complementary. Serve it with Jerked Pork Chops or any grilled meat."
5001434~_(Tamago Toji Udon)
5000685~"When Chris Lilly is at the grill and says to you, ""Come on back and have a bite when this is ready,"" he's not making polite idle talk. Take him seriously. Ask him when it will be ready and make a point of being there. Chris, with father-in-law Don McLemore and the Big Bob Gibson competition barbeque team, has brought home so many contest cooking and sauce awards to his hometown of Decatur, Alabama, that we've lost count. Chris has honed his culinary skills to reach far beyond the basic superb down-home flavors of Alabama barbequed pork and chicken. This grilled flank steak recipe is a perfect marriage of authentic Asian flavors and grilling techniques. If you've ever enjoyed grilled meat skewers at an Asian farmers' market—Guangzhou, for example—this dish will put some good memories and wow in your mouth. Chris's version is second to none!"

5000688~This dessert is an Italian takeoff on a classic French dish, Poire Belle-Hélène-poached pear with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Here the pear is teamed with a hazelnut-orange_semifreddo_ (a sweet Italian frozen mousse) and a Frangelico chocolate sauce. For smaller appetites, cut the semifreddo into eight portions and the pears in half.

5010013~This recipe is an accompaniment for Daniel Boulud's Short Ribs Braised in Red Wine with Celery Duo.
5018862~Chef Boulud says that the success of this dish rests on browning the short ribs well at the beginning of cooking the dish to get the best flavors into the sauce. The Celery Duo starts with a celery root puree and ends with the braised ribs that top the beef. This recipe also can be found in the Café Boulud Cookbook, by Daniel Boulud and Dorie Greenspan.
5000712~We loved L.A. chef Mary Sue Milliken's crisp baked-tortilla crackers in her pool-party menu (August 2000). Here, we invent our own version of them.
5012080~This would be a hot contender for South Africa's national dish! The recipe was selected for an international recipe book published in 1951 by the United Nations Organisation. Bobotie is a Cape-Malay creation, and they spice it up even more with cumin, coriander and cloves. A similar dish was known in Europe in the middle ages after the Crusaders had brought turmeric from the East. When our first Dutch settlers arrived, Holland was largely influenced by Italian cooks, and a favorite dish was a hashed meat backed with curried sauce, spiked with red pepper and 'sweetened with blanched almonds.' There are many local variations, but the idea is that the mince should be tender and creamy in texture, which means long, slow cooking. Early cooks added a little tamarind water; lemon rind and juice is a more modern adaptation.

5000719~Highly recommended!
5012644~The quantity of meat you'll have in your finished stock will vary depending on whether you use shanks or hocks. Although shanks from the butcher yield more meat, they are not as widely available as hocks, which can be found at most supermarkets.
5000721~Any heavy cream that's beaten long enough turns into butter, of course. But by incorporating one extra step in the process—culturing the cream with buttermilk or yogurt, essentially turning it into tangy, funky crème fraîche—this recipe reaches a whole new depth of flavor.
5000722~A little honey in the marinade helps these cutlets caramelize, guaranteeing they'll be nicely browned despite the super-short cooking time.
5009344~The longer you cook this nourishing broth, the more savory and concentrated it will become. Roasting the bones and vegetables beforehand will add even more flavor and richness. Season and sip this restorative broth on its own, use it as a cooking liquid for grains or legumes, or deploy it as a base for sauces and soups like hearty, healthy Detox Pho.
5000724~When buying green beans, look for the skinniest ones—they have the best texture. Offer plenty of crusty bread, and open a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon to go with this hearty main-course salad.
5000725~Thinly sliced garlic is simmered in olive oil until it is so tender that it nearly melts.
5000726~This vegetarian version of the classic French salad is brimming with bright spring vegetables, a lemony Dijon dressing, and tangy fried capers.
5000727~Highly recommended!
5000728~Lovely served at breakfast with butter or cream cheese.
5000729~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5000730~Soup is a great way to use up leftover greens, especially the leafy tops of beets or turnips, which too often get tossed in the compost pile. In this suave, satisfying soup, braising beet tops and collard greens (left over, respectively, from Smoked–Sable Tartare with Beets and Watercress and Wild–Mushroom Bundles ) with fennel and onion mellows the greens' hearty flavor and brings out a surprising smoothness (heightened by the cream stirred in at the end). Adding the spinach just before blending helps keep the color bright.
5005509~For best flavor and moist, juicy meat, brine the turkey for 36 to 48 hours. If you are planning to brine it in a cooler, plan on needing extra ice. Kosher salt is preferred in most brine recipes for its pure flavor and because it dissolves quickly.
5000732~The truffled fries are an inspired, luxurious accompaniment.
5005692~Grill the tomatoes just before you place the eggplants in the coals.

5000738~The combination of meat and fruit is common in Middle Eastern cuisine. If you aren't familiar with quinces, you might mistake them for hard, yellow apples. They are too tart to eat raw, but become fragrantly delicious (and a lovely shade of pink) when cooked with sugar. Serve this dish with the bulgur with apricots and almonds.
5000739~Highly recommended!
5000740~"The Lenz Winery, one of the oldest on Long Island, has had the same winemaker, Eric Fry, since 1989. Fry's mantra is ""Ripe fruit!"" — and hows in the Lenz Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine has an amazing concentration of flavors, an intense raspberry and black-cherry nose, and smooth tannins that provide a long finish. In short, it's a perfect partner for Fry's deeply flavored venison stew."
5000741~"The word mash means mung bean in Farsi and Farsi-related languages like Azeri and Tajik, as well as in Turkic languages such as Uzbek and Uighur. The word kichiri is like the Hindi word kitchri, a name for rice dishes made by cooking rice together with other ingredients. (The British took the idea and the name and turned it into ""kedgeree."")"

5000745~"Armandino Batali of Salumi in Seattle, writes: ""My son, Mario Batali, may be the most recognizable foodie in the family, but the Batalis' interest in Italian cooking and culture goes back generations. My grandfather opened Seattle's first Italian-food import store in 1903. It was located just a few steps from where my restaurant, Salumi, is now, and it's one of the things that inspired me to get into the business."

5000747~The Cobb is a protein-packed salad that will stick with your kids through the school day. This version relies on smoked turkey for the signature flavor that typically comes from bacon. Blue cheese is an optional add-in since its flavor is too strong for a lot of little ones. The assembly is more composed than chopped, which makes it as pretty as it is tasty.
5000748~Use fresh oysters if you can; note that the recipe also tested well using oysters packed in jars. If the oysters are very large, cut them in half.

5009676~Some say using a blender rather than a food processor results in a smoother puree. When combining pesto with pasta, Ligurians mix a small ladle of the cooking water into the pesto just before adding the noodles; this dilutes the concentrated sauce and helps it adhere to the pasta.

5000775~A certain well-known take-out chicken with eleven herbs and spices is not the only Southern fried chicken that is seasoned with a complex blend of herbs and spices; it is just one of many. You can experiment with the combination until you have your own unique blend. If you don't have a couple of the spices on hand, feel free to omit them. When deep-fried, which is the way I prefer to cook this one, the chicken makes great picnic fare because it stays crispy long after it's cold, and the spice and herb seasoning stands up well to other highly seasoned picnic food.
5000776~What to drink: Sauvignon Blanc or a dry rosé, such as a French Bandol.
5000777~"Sabrina Henderson of Gardena, California, writes: ""After 17 years of making dinner for my family, I don't cook as much as I used to. These days what I really enjoy doing is baking. Not only is it more leisurely, but people enjoy the results so much. About twice a month my husband takes some of my homemade cookies to his colleagues who always ask when I'm going to send something their way. The staff in the doctor's office where I work will often ask me the same thing. My zucchini bread is a special favorite. I joke with people and tell them I'll bring it in, but only if they behave."""

The sweet juiciness of golden pineapples — much more intensely flavored than ordinary pineapples — balances the spices with the lusciousness that only tropical foods possess.

5000812~"This is perfect with mashed potatoes. What to drink: Terra dei Re 2003 ""Vultur"" Aglianico del Vulture from Italy ($20), with aromas of spice, as well as plummy flavors, juicy acidity, and smooth tannins."
5000813~Highly recommended!
5000814~Oven-roasted red potato chunks sprinkled with chives; steamed and buttered baby carrots; and a limestone lettuce salad would be good accompaniments to this elegant main course. Finish with a strawberry-rhubarb pie from the bakery.
5000815~Highly recommended!
5000816~Homemade pound cake hits all the right notes—it's buttery, rich, and immensely satisfying. This version is classic, with hints of lemon and orange, perfect with afternoon tea.

5000819~"A rack is one of the most luxurious cuts from the lamb and makes a dramatic roast. Count on two ribs per person (four servings per rack) if you're using American lamb and four ribs per serving if you're using New Zealand or Australian lamb. When carving, alternate sides as you serve the ribs so one person isn't stuck with the ""seconds,"" the ribs from the shoulder end of the rack.
If you have a double rack of lamb, split it. This removes the chine bone automatically. If you have a single rack, make sure the butcher trims off the chine bone so you can carve the rack easily. French the rack and remove the layer of fat that covers half of the rack on the shoulder end. This helps the meat to cook evenly."
5000820~Thanks to Simon and Garfunkel, the fresh herbs in this dish are forever linked. But the folk duo probably never knew how good they are on top of al dente bucatini, a thicker-than-spaghetti hollow noodle.
5003070~In Austria this is called Krambambuli.
5000822~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5000823~The perennial Christmas gift gets a luscious face-lift in this impressive cake. We guarantee that it won't get shuffled around, and no one will make any jokes about it. Store the cake in the refrigerate for up to three weeks before giving. Wrap it in some red or green cellophane, and present it in a decorative box (a hatbox is fun) tied with a big, bright bow.
5000824~Highly recommended!
5016972~Geelrys (yellow rice) is great with bobotie and curry. Its other name, begrafnisrys (funeral rice) comes from the fact that it was always part of the meal served after funerals, a tradition of both the Dutch and the Cape Malays.
5000826~If you love the citrusy bite of Campari, it’s time to meet your new summer drink. The Sicilian Slush pairs the Italian aperitivo with herbal gin and plenty of freshly squeezed orange juice to create a blush-pink, bittersweet slushie that delivers even more refreshment.
5000827~This duck recipe is unusually light and delicate.
5000828~A drizzle of chipotle-accented cream boosts the flavors in this refreshing summer soup.

5000832~Complete the main course with buttered sweet potato chunks (they can roast alongside the chicken) and sautéed Swiss chard. Serve purchased éclairs for dessert.
5000833~Cream cheese enhances the texture of the custard in this tart. To create the pretty wave pattern, use an icing comb, available in cookware stores. Begin making the dessert a day ahead.
5000834~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016078~This recipe was created by chef Dan Barber of Blue Hill restaurant in New York City and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York. It's part of a special menu he created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program and is used in his Summer Salad. The recipe makes more than enough lemon oil, but it stores well in the refrigerator and can be served with fish or used to flavor dips.

5008898~This fish is steamed on plates, which hold the marinade and juices around the fillets. Be sure that the plates you use have enough of a rim to hold some liquid, and are not larger in diameter than the pan you'll be using to steam.
5000842~We adopted contributing editor Jon Rowley's technique for poaching salmon in water salted like the sea. This method imparts a touch of brine and enables the other seasonings to permeate the fish. Cut into very thick steaks instead of left whole, the fish is easier to handle and doesn't require a poacher. The creamy sauce makes for a sophisticated finish.
5000843~Melting the chocolate in the pear poaching liquid makes an instant sauce.
5000844~Highly recommended!
5002232~A great partner for some good Champagne. Brown sugar and black pepper make the almonds sweet and spicy.

5000851~Sun-dried tomatoes add a touch of sweetness and just the right hit of acid to balance out the spicy sausage and pleasingly bitter notes of radicchio in this simple pasta.
5000852~Shishito peppers give a mildly spicy kick to this old-school breakfast classic. If you can't find them at your farmer's market, use any chile pepper with a similar heat level, like poblanos or pimentos de Padron.
5000853~"""There's a terrific place called Grand Central Cafe and Bakery in Portland, Oregon. I tried their Jammers, which are luscious buttermilk biscuits filled with jam,"" says Lori Stiffler of Butte, Montana."

5012952~This is my standard duck or goose stock. It is the stock that I call for in the recipes in this book. In other words, you need to make lots. Every time you get a carcass, save it for stock. If you dont have a lot of ducks around at one time, save them up for future rounds of stock making. You can chop up the carcasses before freezing, so they take up less space.

5000879~Cooking the curry powder with the vegetables mellows its flavor.
5000880~This luxe burger gets its umami-packed richness from dry-aged steak. Yep, you read that right, we grind beautiful steaks to make a burger. One bite of the juicy patty, steak sauce–flavored onions, and rich herb butter (inspired by Béarnaise sauce, a classic steak condiment) and you'll know it's worth every penny.
5014025~"""My profession as a real estate agent requires a lot of my time,"" writes Edi Meadows Morrissette of Westin, Florida, ""so it helps that I am lightning-fast in the kitchen. I cook every day, and on the weekends I sometimes make three meals a day. I accomplish that by following my main cooking principles: (1) do a lot of prep work, and (2) keep the kitchen well stocked. For example, at holiday time I might chop onions in advance or bake bread the day before company arrives. And since I converted the bedroom next to my kitchen into a pantry for extra storage, I know I'll always have the right ingredients at my fingertips."""

5003299~If most of the coconut sauces you've encountered have been heavy and cloying, this one — light and frothy, with delicate flavor — will be a delicious surprise. It would also be perfect for spicing up poached skinless boneless chicken.
5000888~An intense dark-chocolate filling topped with sweet-tangy cream.
5000889~Umami-loaded ingredients (tofu and miso) make this the most addictive ranch ever.
5012327~It's good news for America that grass-fed beef is increasingly available in supermarkets. Cattle were meant to eat grass, and they are efficient at converting that green goodness into nutrient-dense meat, rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamins A and E, to say nothing of environmental benefits. Because grass-fed beef is leaner than grain-fed, it's not quite as tender. So turning it into a meatloaf is a greatand economicalway to make a meal of it.
5000891~Tostadas caseras — corn tortillas that have been seasoned and fried — can be found with the tortillas in most supermarkets. The soup can be made one day before serving.
5000892~This remarkable sabayon, made with egg yolks left over from Spiced–Pumpkin Soufflés with Bourbon Molasses Sauce , tastes like a very lush and airy lemon curd. Pairing it with juicy segments of grapefruit creates a delightful call and response between the two citruses and their varying decibels of sweetness and tart zing. (The sabayon also pairs well with oranges or berries.) Though it is traditional to serve sabayon still warm—from the simmering water over which it is whisked—this version also tastes delicious chilled.

5000895~Deep dark chocolate and lush ripe plums make a sweet match in this decadent late summer dessert.
5000896~Both cardamom and pistachios are essential ingredients in Persian dessert making. This dough is delicate because it doesn’t contain any gluten, so be sure it’s fully chilled and firm before rolling into logs and slicing into cookies.
5000897~Using the fresh-tasting canned diced tomatoes eliminates the chopping step. Serve with: Arugula and radicchio salad.
5000898~Bibimbop
5000899~The black pepper adds a surprising aromatic and spicy flavor to the sweet grilled peaches. The recipe here makes more syrup than you'll likely need but it will keep in the refrigerator for at least 1 week and is great in a cocktail or with sparkling water.
5018354~You can freeze the dough flavored or unflavored, in logs or not—for up to two weeks.

5000908~The French like to cook using small amounts of intensely flavored ingredients, such as balsamic vinegar and goat cheese.
5000909~Highly recommended!
5000910~This dish has a livelier, fresher taste than traditional risotto because the vegetables are cooked separately from the rice and then spooned over it in a rich ragout.

5008768~First the turkey is soaked overnight in a brine to improve flavor and ensure moist meat. (Be sure to use a pot large enough to hold both the brine and the turkey.) The smokiness of the turkey is offset beautifully by the tangy, sweet glaze, which incorporates two quintessential Napa Valley ingredients: wine and mustard.
5006881~With some warm corn bread, this chili is a meal in itself. You wouldn't know there was chocolate in the recipe, but it adds a subtle depth of flavor to the dish.

5000922~Serve atop mashed potatoes or, for a nice twist, on a piece of toasted garlic bread.
5016817~Here's our version of Barba Yianni's grilled lamb. The marinade works equally well with lamb chops, kebabs, or butterflied leg of lamb. You can also use it on pork or chicken. Skordalia is often made with mashed potatoes or bread soaked in water, but we feel the yogurt gives it more flavor. Skordalia is also good with grilled fish or chicken breasts.
5000924~Not in the mood for bread? No problem. This no-mayo lobster mixture would also make an ideal centerpiece in a summer salad.

5000929~"This ham, bell pepper, and onion-filled diner classic is also sometimes called a ""Denver Omelet."""
5000930~A flavorful turkey prepared in an interesting way. It is soaked in brine, which helps tenderize the bird, and then rubbed with a citrus-thyme butter. The butter keeps the turkey moist and also enriches the pan drippings for the gravy. The stuffing borrows from the long tradition of corn breads in America. Be sure to make the Giblet Broth before you start roasting the turkey. Pour hard cider throughout dinner.
5000931~If you can't find green garlic, just blanch a regular garlic clove in boiling water for two minutes to soften its bite.

5000933~Seedless watermelons are on the market these days, but I prefer the old-fashioned ones with big black seeds — easy to see and remove. Then proceed with the recipe.
5000934~Toast a slice of this bread, and serve it with butter or cream cheese for breakfast.
5000935~This version of a tagine, the classic Moroccan stew, calls for dark meat because it stays moist when braised. If you prefer white meat, reduce the cooking time by 15 minutes.
5000936~"""Cooking is my passion, and my husband and some of our friends share it,"" Kim Bartel, Youngstown, Ohio. ""Our favorite weekend activity is making dinner together and pairing it with wine.

5000937~Rich with chocolate and studded with bits of toasted almonds with a faint coconut flavor, this heavenly dessert is a special finish to a holiday meal. Because the leavening comes from aeration, it is essential that the ingredients be at room temperature before assembling the batter.

5000962~Adjust the strength of the coffee to suit your taste, using 1 cup of ground beans for milder coffee or 1 1/2 cups for a stronger brew. The recipe calls for chocolate-almond-flavored coffee beans, but go ahead and try any flavor you like.
5000963~Here, we pepped up the fail-safe brunch combination of bacon, egg, and cheese by adding handfuls of flavorful sautéed arugula. They'll be jumping out of bed for this one.
5000964~In a twist on the classic Italian combination of peaches and Amaretto, Ferrigno pairs fresh apricots with a seriously over-the-top syrup, made with amaretti and the liqueur, that plays up the complexity of the sweet-and-tart fruit.
5000965~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5000970~The Scandinavian liquor aquavit adds unique flavor to this appetizer. Pour Champagne and chilled Alsace Riesling with the meal; offer lemonade with a touch of grenadine, too.
5000971~Larry's inspiration for this soup was a dish that he enjoyed while vacationing in Japan. Look for the oriental sesame oil in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.

5000976~During a research trip to Hong Kong, food editor Ian Knauer discovered that every family has its own recipe for five-spice powder, a pivotal ingredient in so many Chinese dishes. He took things a step further by adding black peppercorns to the aromatic mix, which holds its own against the robust flavor of hanger steak. As for side dishes, this would be delicious with steamed rice and stir-fried bok choy, but your menu doesn't have to be Asian—try it with a brightly dressed green salad and roasted potatoes.
5001527~This recipe originally accompanied Lemongrass Consommé with Matzoh Balls, Leeks, and Shiitake Mushrooms
5013750~Highly recommended!
5000979~"Recently, I have become a bit of a chicken thigh person, finding the meat moister and more succulent than the ubiquitous chicken breast. The addition of harissa, the spicy, tomato-y Moroccan paste, adds a subtle kick to this ""hunter-style"" Italian dish, but for those not in love with an extra bit of spice, then tomato purée works beautifully too."
5000980~This soup has the classic flavors of a baked potato topped with sour cream and chives. It would be perfect as a starter to a meal of steak and salad, or terrific teamed with crusty bread for lunch.
5000981~If you are not able to find Pont l'Evêque cheese, either Taleggio or Brie would also work well in this lovely starter from Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.

5000984~21st Century Recipe
5000985~One of the secrets to this raw salmon dish from Seattle restaurant Madison Park Conservatory is an amazing Moroccan spice blend called ras el hanout. It's like a curry powder in that there are a billion unique combinations, with each cook creating his or her own, though most include Moroccan favorites like cardamom, ginger, or mace. The blend is sold in fancy grocery stores or in Middle Eastern markets like the one near us in Pike Place Market that smells like heaven. You can also buy it online. If you can't find Greek yogurt, let plain yogurt drain a bit in a colander until thick before using.
5000986~One-pot dishes are all about planning well and laying out your prep in a smart sequential order. The beauty of this dish is the vinegar, which is malty, nutty, and nuanced. I love a Philippine cane vinegar called Datu Puti. Great stuff, super-inexpensive, and readily available at most Asian grocery stores.

5001004~Ca ri ga
5014307~A Chinese meal is incomplete without something leafy, and this dish features a wonderful green. The pleasant bite of gai lan, or Chinese broccoli, complements stir-fried shrimp beautifully; once you've tried it, you'll be eager to cook with it again.
5001006~Look for deveined shrimp still in the shell at the seafood counter or in the frozen foods section of the market. If you like, marinate the chicken and shrimp for an hour at room temperature or two hours in the fridge, turning skewers occasionally.
5001007~Golden Delicious apples, as well as other good baking varieties like Rome Beauty, are a natural choice here.
5011247~"You know the Juicy Lucy, right? It's a cheese-stuffed burger that was born in Minneapolis in the 1950s, and legend has it that it got its name when the first patron took a bite and exclaimed, ""That's one juicy lucy!"" Well, my friend Erin Meister, who blogs as The Nervous Cook, sent me her take on it: a marinated portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a runny-yolk egg. A total umami bomb and, like the Juicy Lucy, a mess to eat. But when you're cooking for yourself who cares if you have egg on your face? Erin marinates the mushroom in a miso-vinegar mixture, but since I usually have Sesame Miso Vinaigrette on hand, it's perfect to use here, too. If you don't have it, substitute 1 tablespoon of white miso in 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar. If you don't have a grill, don't sweat it; you won't get the smoky tinge, but this works just fine instead, using a cast-iron skillet or grill pan fitted with a lid (or aluminum foil)."
5001009~Aioli, the garlicky Provençal mayonnaise, is accented with chives and Dijon mustard.
5001010~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018487~Dashi is a traditional Asian stock. The recipe is simple—the only ingredients are dried kelp (seaweed) and flakes of dried bonito, a type of fish. However, both ingredients are packed with flavor, creating a rich, aromatic broth.
5001012~Highly recommended!
5014894~Improv: You can also use the spice mixture on salmon, chicken pieces, or shrimp.
5001014~This spinach salad speaks to all the wonderful autumnal flavors of the Pacific Northwest. The new crop of bronzed Bosc pears is piled high at the farmers' market; the hazelnuts have been harvested, shelled, and bagged for sale; and the cranberries arrive from the Long Beach, Washington, coastal bogs. I buy sweetened dried cranberries from a local producer, but they are readily available at the grocery store (Ocean Spray is a good-quality packager), found alongside raisins and other dried fruits. This salad is a snap to assemble if you buy the packaged prewashed and trimmed baby spinach.
5013057~My son's teachers beg me to make this cake for his snack day at school. It isn't too sweet, and it has a moist, dense texture from the carrots and pineapple. It's also one of my most popular cakes at weddings and parties. When I make it at home, I throw more things into the batter—for example, a handful of pumpkin seeds or toasted pecans if I have them lying around. The beauty of this recipe is that you can increase the spices or omit the nuts, and it will still taste great.
5010975~Rice paper is available in the Asian-foods section of many supermarkets.
5007654~Chilies, lime juice and mint enhance the flavor of our Thai Summer Rolls .

5001026~"These parfaits (or budini — Italian for ""puddings"") of ultra-creamy mascarpone layered with Marsala-soaked strawberries perfectly illustrate the way of dessert in Italy: utterly simple, not too sweet, and delicious."
5008941~This dough can also be formed into crescent shapes and coated with confectioners' sugar while still warm, as is done in many eastern European countries.
5001028~This preparation is easily scaled up for a bigger piece of fish (and larger family), so double it if you wish.
5001029~With the mercury rising, who wants to feast on a winter stew? Lighten up with this dish from Sondra Bernstein, author of The Girl & the Fig Cookbook (Simon &Schuster). It features fresh herbs and veggies and a protein-packed halibut fillet. Then, instead of hitting the couch to digest, you can hit the pavement for an after-dinner stroll.
5001030~For a more substantial meal, add cooked udon noodles to the broth.
5001031~This is my version of harira, the national soup of Morocco, which shows up in unending variations from city to city, street stall to street stall, and family to family. It can be vegan, vegetarian, or made with meat—usually lamb. Some cooks add chickpeas, chicken gizzards, or broken-up bits of angel hair pasta. But the result is always unmistakably harira, and that's what makes it so comforting and satisfying.
5001032~Substituting rice vinegar (instead of cider or wine vinegar) produces a pickle that's less tart.

5001038~"The parts of Corsica that are not cultivated or forested are covered with a thick underbrush called the Maquis. It consists of diverse aromatic herbs that make the hillsides white with little flowers in the spring and inspire one of the island's nicknames, ""the Scented Isle."" A blend of these herbs, called herbes de maquis, is a flavoring for many seafood specialties, including this rich pasta and lobster dish. Many say that the most flavorful lobsters in the Mediterranean come from the waters off Corsica."

But making salted brown butter the flavor base of a cookie will turn your holiday cookie swap into the hottest, hippest party in town. Thankfully, the dough is a dream to roll out, and it's strong enough to keep the shape of the cookie-cutters you use, no matter how intricate. Want to hang them on the tree? Just cut a little hole before baking with the narrow end of a pastry bag tip.

On school vacations I would go home and cook with my mother and sisters so that I wouldn't lose my touch. My mother was a skilled cook, and I was lucky to have learned at her side. Her food was so popular in our neighborhood that she sold portions of our daily meals to other families. With nine well-fed kids, she said we were her best advertisement."

5001074~Let’s put it this way: If you like salsa verde, you’ll love charmoula, its spiced cousin. Try it with our Grilled Brined Vegetables.
5001075~A fusion of flavors and technique from two cuisines makes this main course taste new. The cooking method is based on an Italian fricassea made with egg yolks and cream; the combination of favas and mint is Middle Eastern. The resulting dish is absolutely delicious.

The filling requires no baking, is quick to prepare, and can be varied to suit whatever combination of berries and fruits is in season. The technique is simple: some of the fruit is first mashed and cooked into a thickened sauce. Then the remaining fresh fruit is stirred in and the entire mixture turned out into a completely prebaked pastry shell and chilled. The filling can also be served as a pudding without any pastry.

5001259~Vanilla bean and brandy accent the cake, and a few raspberries tint the peach topping a delicate pink.
5001260~Highly recommended!
5007348~These wholesome flapjacks are filled with the energy-boosting carbohydrates found in whole wheat flour and multigrain oatmeal. The fat is kept down by using low-fat cottage cheese, only two egg yolks and just two tablespoons of milk. To cook the pancakes, make sure to use a nonstick skillet brushed lightly with oil. Top them with the Peach and Berry Salad, and serve with reduced-fat sausages.
5001262~When you combine powdered chiles with cumin and other ingredients to make a spice mix for chili con carne, you are turning chile powder into chili powder.
5001263~Highly recommended!
5008570~The roast can be prepped one day ahead. What to drink: A robust, medium- to full-bodied red, such as an Italian Barbera. Susan Simon also recommends a Carlo Hauner 1998 Rosso Antonello (made with Sangiovese and Nero d'Avolo grapes); it's produced on the Italian island of Salina.
5016091~This recipe yields enough sauce to glaze three pounds of meat. We doubled it for the chicken and ribs at our barbecue party. You'll use about half to marinate and glaze the meat while cooking, and the rest as a condiment on the buffet for those who like it really saucy.
5001266~Editor's note: The recipe below is excerpted from Cal-a-Vie Living: Gourmet Spa Cuisine and is part of a healthy and delicious spa menu developed exclusively for Epicurious by Cal-a-Vie.
5001267~Highly recommended!
5001268~The anchovy butter would also be terrific on steak or steamed green beans.
5005293~If you are making the creamed grilled corn and are using a charcoal grill, grill the corn first, then add more briquettes to keep the fire hot while you finish up the corn dish on the stove. Then keep the corn warm, covered, over low heat while grilling the grilled scallions with lemon and pork.
5001270~Richly marbled beef ribs beg for something crisp and refreshing to go alongside. If celery’s not your fave, try swapping it for any type of radish, escarole, or a tart apple.
5001271~One of those dreamy cookies elicits a silent reverence in every chocolate lover who tastes it.
5001272~The crisp-tender texture and robust flavor of thinly sliced Tuscan kale stands up to the tart, Caesar-like dressing of this hearty slaw. Serve as a first course or as a side with grilled chicken, beef, or lamb.
5002926~One buttercream base makes two frosting flavors. Vanilla tops the orange cupcakes , and almond tops the devil's food . Be sure to use unsprayed (nontoxic) roses for decoration.
5001274~The perfect dessert for your next barbecue: This chilled pie is an appealing combination of chocolate, berries, and lemon. And all it takes is a food processor and a whisk. The crust—made from chocolate wafer cookies and melted chocolate—is simply pressed into the pan. The filling is just a mix of sweet, bright, and tangy ingredients.
5014624~Like the cake layers, the frosting is made in two separate batches; each batch yields about eight cups.
5001276~Highly recommended!
5001277~Highly recommended!
5001278~The heartland is known for its grains and its pork; this first course features two of the region's best products—corn and bacon.
5001279~Highly recommended!
5001280~We've lightened traditional meatballs with veal and added Mediterranean accents to achieve a bright, springtime flavor. Chicken broth and matzo meal take the place of milk and bread crumbs to keep the meatballs exceptionally tender.
5001281~It might seem like a joke to include a recipe designed to use up leftover white wine (from our Roast Turkey with Black Truffle Butter and White–Wine Gravy )—after all, why not just drink it?—but if you take the time to make this marvelous one–dish lamb dinner, you might find yourself hoarding half–empty bottles so you can make it again and again. Lamb shoulder chops are an inexpensive cut that benefits from braising, and the wine really helps tenderize the connective tissues running through the flavorful meat. Snuggling the lamb between sheets of thinly sliced potatoes, plus scatterings of golden garlic, onions, and thyme sprigs, creates a handsome and wonderfully aromatic dish.
5001282~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5001292~Slow-roasting fish is to cooking seafood what bumper lanes are to bowling: the definition of foolproof—and still pretty fun.
5001293~Hard-boiled eggs, sour cream, and onion are traditional accompaniments for caviar. In this longtime staple of community cookbooks, they are turned into a shallow cake and spread with caviar. We used supermarket lumpfish caviar, but if you're feeling flush, use the good stuff, or even Japanese tobiko (flying-fish roe).

5001300~This dish — meant to be eaten with your fingers or with wooden picks — is a light, refreshing hors d'oeuvre to complement tequila. The recipe is a take on the jicama and cucumber spears that are a popular Mexican street snack.

5020022~Once you try this easy and delicious recipe, you'll never buy grocery-store ricotta again.
5001303~Highly recommended!
5015134~Like tsatsiki, but with cilantro standing in for the mint, this tangy sauce packs a sneaky cayenne kick and makes an ideal accompaniment to grilled shrimp as well as the rice pilaf and the chicken kebabs.
5013577~Soaking the chicken overnight in a yogurt marinade results in pillow-tender chunks faintly flavored with garlic. Turmeric adds a spark of Middle Eastern flavor and a happy orange hue.
5009767~This lamb-rich, Uzbek-style pilaf is typical of the fare served by northern Afghans to mark festive occasions. Despite the absence of spices and herbs, it is a surprisingly complex dish.
5001307~Highly recommended!
5015942~Roasting the potatoes with the lamb gives them a wonderfully rich, meaty flavor.

5001311~Highly recommended!
5001312~Heating the sugar before beating it into the egg whites creates an extra-glossy, stable meringue.
5001313~Note: To slice the onion and fennel in the following salad into paper-thin spirals, we used a Japanese rotary device known as the Benriner vegetable slicer.
5002915~Serve with: Buttered noodles and steamed Swiss chard. Dessert: A bakery Linzertorte.
5001315~Jellied candies like these are eaten all over Europe as post-dessert petits fours.
5001316~Latin-food authority Maricel Presilla describes sofrito—the sautéed mix of aromatic vegetables that is the bedrock of this vegetarian soup—as the DNA of the Latin kitchen because it carries a basic flavor code. There's onion and garlic, to be sure, but also tomatoes and various herbs, spices, and chiles, depending on the region. For this red-bean soup, we were inspired specifically by Puerto Rico, as evidenced by recao (an herb similar to cilantro) and by chiles that are fruity rather than hot. Just for fun, we included a last-minute sprinkling of Italian gremolata for brightness.
5001317~Garnish this warming drink with lemon slices and a cinnamon stick.
5001318~Many kinds of vegetables and even some fruits go well with this versatile dip.
5001319~"These classic pleated Chinese dumplings are delicious either steamed or fried. When fried, they're called ""pot stickers."" Though the dough is easy to make, if you're short on time you can use premade round gyoza wrappers (also called dumpling or pot sticker wrappers) instead. Look for them in Asian markets and the refrigerated section of many grocery stores."
5001320~There will be more pecan pesto than you need for the beans, but it keeps well and can also be used on pasta, as a sandwich spread, or in potato salad.

5001328~Slice it and serve with our soft dinner rolls so guests can make mini sandwiches, then use the bone to make soup. Ask your butcher for a whole cured, smoked bone-in ham from the back leg of a pig, or order one from dartagnan.com (ask for the applewood-smoked bone-in whole ham). You can also buy a half ham and cut the recipe in half. Flavor the meat with Riesling from the same bottle you use to make the gelée for the chicken liver mousse .
5001329~Aptly named beluga lentils look like little beads of caviar. They cook quickly, and they hold their shape. Use them in this recipe, or substitute.
5001330~Whether at home or on vacation, pancakes are a family affair at Debra's house every Saturday morning, and banana is her children's favorite kind. But don't limit yourself: blueberries, strawberries, and nectarines all taste equally delicious. Try lightly toasting the pecans for a decidedly adult flavor, or substitute chopped walnuts.
5013147~"We were enchanted by Segovia-Welshs idea of cold ice cream flavored with ""warming"" spices such as those found in the fragrant Chinese blend called five-spice powder. It turns the honest little caramel pecan cakes into something suave."
5001332~Highly recommended!
5018976~Highly recommended!
5001334~A straightforward stovetop braise makes this savory chicken just right for a weeknight. A little chipotle chile powder (left over from Pork Spice Rub ) gives the chicken a spark of heat, while lime juice and cilantro bring freshness to the cooking liquid. Serve this with Warm Herbed Coriander Rice Salad and your meal's complete.
5001335~For an elegant touch, serve the cobbler in oversize goblets and top with ice cream.
5001336~The clams give up all their essence in this rich coconut-based stock. It's great for curries, or use it as the liquid base for a pot of steamed mussels or littleneck clams.
5001337~Slightly bruised or wrinkled stone fruit is ideal for making the infused syrup; peaches and nectarines work too.

5001346~This hearty and satisfying main course, from Kokkari in San Francisco, was inspired by the flavors of Greece.
5001609~The frittata will be easier to remove from the skillet if it sits for a few minutes—the top will deflate and the edges will pull away from the pan.
5001348~Highly recommended!
5001349~A big, beautiful soufflé with a festive chestnut flavor. Youll need to bake the dessert right before serving, but you can make the soufflé base (minus the egg whites) two hours ahead, then fold in the whites up to one hour before baking.
5001350~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5001351~We know: Another kale salad recipe! But don’t write this one off—you’ve probably never had roasted ginger before. It’s what makes this dish special.
5017874~Editor's note: Use this recipe to make Joanne Chang's Breakfast Pizzas .
5001353~Most recipes for steamed mussels call for crusty bread on the side. Here, slices of bread are baked right on top of the mussels. To be sure everyone can enjoy the delicious juices in the bottom of the pans, serve this entrée straight from the cast-iron skillets (use trivets to protect the table).
5001354~Highly recommended!
5001355~Highly recommended!

5018713~Thanks to a few humble additions—sun-dried tomatoes, sweet smoked paprika, and leafy spinach—these saucy beans have real pizzazz. Best of all, the dish requires little more than a quick sauté and simmer.
5001362~Highly recommended!
5001363~Roasting the lamb on a large oven or cake rack that's placed over the gratin dish allows its succulent juices to flavor the vegetables. This spring dish is one of my favorite recipes from Bistro Cooking (Workman, 1989), by Patricia Wells.
5001364~Make the slaw and chill it up to two hours before serving. It is best cold.
5001365~Chinese fermented black beans are a bargain—the small amount here packs a pungent, salty flavor that complements the sweet, garlicky sauce for the wings.
5018329~Highly recommended!
5001367~Note: To slice the cucumber in the following recipe into a paper-thin spiral, we used a Japanese rotary device known as the Benriner vegetable slicer.
5001368~Summer's bounty gets even better when it's combined in a fresh-tasting pasta.
5002546~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less, but requires additional unattended time.
5001370~Don’t braise your short ribs—grill them. They’re intensely beefy, with gorgeous marbling that encourages crispy bits.
5001371~In most parts of Texas, enchiladas are rolled tortillas stuffed with a filling and covered in sauce. But often in West Texas (and also New Mexico) the filling and sauce are instead layered between flat tortillas. They look a bit different, but the end taste is the same, not to mention stacked enchiladas are a heck of a lot easier to make.
5001372~Try a glass of Rioja and some crusty bread with this lovely autumn dish.
5004338~Start this dish at least 4 hours ahead. The chicken can also marinate overnight. What to drink: A delicate white wine with floral aromas, like Pinot Gris from Austria or Alsace.
5001374~This all-butter pie crust relies on a hint of red wine vinegar for balance and it's tenderizing effects.
5001375~Every October as kids, we loved to go pumpkin picking and buy fresh pumpkins. Our grandmother would take the pumpkin flesh and bake it in the oven with a little cinnamon and sugar, and then we’d stick it in the blender, puree it, and use it for baking. We’d bake pumpkin bread, pumpkin cake, and pumpkin pie, and we would also roast the pumpkin seeds in the oven. Really, she used every single part of that pumpkin! The thing we loved the most was our grandmother’s pumpkin cake. It was more of a cake-bread hybrid: very dense and savory yet sweet. It smelled amazing coming out of the oven. We would sometimes just eat it without any icing, hot from the oven. We’d burn our tongues because we wouldn’t even wait for it to cool!
5001376~The following recipe can also be made with 1-inch-thick salmon fillets.

5001378~A slightly sweet tomato sauce blankets these tender baby back ribs.

5001386~In addition to the tuna, the leeks and garlic are also grilled, giving this simple Mediterranean-inspired pasta sauce complex flavor.
5001387~A rich side dish for pork or lamb chops.
5001388~This beautiful seafood salad makes a terrific home for leftover Niçoise olives from the braised Veal Cacciatore . Quickly cooking the calamari renders it snowy white and very tender—such a nice backdrop to the salty olives and crunchy celery. Scallion, lemon zest, and celery add freshness.

5010725~Churrasco is Spanish for grilled steak. This is Douglas Rodriguez's Argentine interpretation made with pork. He takes slices of tenderloin and pounds them to approximate the thickness of a skirt steak. Marinate the tenderloin strips for two to six hours before grilling.
5001394~For trained foragers, the autumn forests around Lancaster, Pennsylvania, yield an abundant wild mushroom crop.

5001414~Honey cake emerges from its hibernation around the High Holidays in the fall, when honey and other sweet foods are eaten to usher in a sweet new year. But as much as this is an early fall cake for the holidays, its warming spices make it a perfect winter cake that works both for dessert and in the morning with a cup of coffee.

5001419~Ginger beer is a staple in Jamaica, and the best is homemade (it's easy to do, as you'll see in this recipe). Resist the temptation to use commercial ginger beer for this drink — it's too sweet.
5001420~This is a winning-contestant recipe from Season Four of FOX's MasterChef. The recipe calls for making homemade stock—using bones from game hens, chickens, or pigeons—to cook the farro in, but if you're short on time, you can substitute purchased low-sodium chicken broth.
5013338~This bread is a delicious holiday treat.

5017731~South Indians don't use ghee in cooking the way North Indians do, much preferring their coconut oil. But they always have a spoonful with their parboiled rice and dhal. The first step of a Sadhya is mixing ghee, rice, dhal, crushed pappadam, and a little salt. This mixture is eaten by hand and forms the first bites of the Sadhya. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.

5001454~Food editor Maggie Ruggiero touts these amber bars as the love child of rice krispie treats and those sesame candies sold at natural foods stores. They're nutty, both crisp and chewy, and just a bit crumbly—the perfect afternoon snack. Honey and brown sugar lend a touch of sweetness, while egg whites, nuts, and seeds give the bars protein and chewiness.
5001455~Highly recommended!
5001456~If you're ever cornered by a bland bowl of vegetables or whole grains, throw a handful of herbs on it. They instantly make the meal more beautiful and flavorful—without adding any salt, fat, or sugar.

5001459~Smoked Turkey, Cheese, and Bacon Tortilla Rolls
5001460~The pancetta and cheese rind give this soup a rich, almost creamy flavor. We removed the stems from the Swiss chard, but if you don't want to waste them, feel free to put them in the soup as well: Once the leaves are sliced, chop the stems and add them to the soup along with the leaves.

This dish originated in Rhode Island during the late 19th century, when, as story has it, Portuguese immigrants added tomatoes to their chowder. British New Englanders believed their creamy chowder to be superior and named the Portuguese version after Manhattan, presuming that New Yorkers were the only people crazy enough to add tomatoes.

5001472~Imagine what would happen if gooey butterscotch cookies and crunchy Cracker Jack had a love child. Caramel corn blondies are born! These are best served the day they are made for the crunchiest texture, but they are still yummy as the popcorn softens. It shouldn't be a problem though, since they take just minutes to throw together.
5001473~Early in this century, fresh meat became a staple on many American tables. But old methods of flavoring and preserving beef-corning, for instance, which involved brining the meat with spices-remained popular. Often in New England, leftover corned beef simmered with vegetables would be chopped up and transformed into red flannel hash, so called because of the crimson color beets gave to the dish.
5001474~Serve as a first course on a bed of arugula or as a side dish with grilled beef or chicken.
5001475~Sugar snap peas and pea tendrils (the young leaves and shoots of the snow pea plant) give this dish a double hit of spring flavor.
5001476~Zhoug is a spicy herb sauce of Yemenite origin that you find in Syria and Israel. It’s often the go-to condiment for falafel and is eaten with bread for those who want heat with every bite. It’s a must with Shakshuka, and you’ll probably find yourself stirring it into scrambled eggs, spreading it on a sandwich, mixing it with Greek yogurt to make a dip, or just eating it by the spoonful.

5001494~I get no greater satisfaction than knowing we've snuck some sweet potatoes and red cabbage onto the dessert menu at Vedge. This dish was originally inspired by a trip to the Czech Republic, where I enjoyed plum dumplings dusted in powdered sugar and served with vegan sour cream. Here, we fill our turnovers with candied whipped sweet potato, and the kraut garnish offers a nice bright note from the sweet Riesling. If you want to go all out, try serving them with a dollop of vegan sour cream whipped with a little powdered sugar and orange zest.
5001495~This fresh salad could be served family-style with the rest of the meal or as a plated first course.
5001496~Korean chefs work with an array of distinct greens for fresh salads, including common red leaf lettuce, but also wild sesame leaves, young radish leaves, garlic chives, and chrysanthemums.

5001503~Variations on the grilled chicken salad were everywhere in recent years. Likewise, balsamic vinegar dressings and marinades often turned up on menus, olivada (olive paste) became a pantry staple, packaged salad greens were popular convenience items, and fennel and radicchio became regulars in the produce bins.
5001504~Freezing the rugelach before baking helps the cookies maintain their shape. For gift giving, layer them between sheets of waxed paper and arrange in tins lined with colorful cellophane or tissue paper.
5001505~"Consider these ""beauty"" bites: They offer up 26 percent of your daily dose of vitamin A, which keeps skin and hair healthy."

5001508~"In this appetizer, the spicy squid and the cooling relish are wrapped in betel (pronounced ""beetle"") leaves, which have a slightly bitter taste. If you can't find betel leaves, Boston or romaine lettuce leaves make a good substitute."
5011972~The foundation of this étouffée-like dish is a brown roux that lends a deep, nutty flavor. The gravy pairs well with the Grits Dressing , biscuits, and turkey.

5001517~Straining the ricotta will tighten the filling, making it easier to roll. Let it hang out in a sieve while you’re measuring everything else out.
5001518~Look for wild salmon fillets. You can ask the fishmonger to remove the pinbones, or remove them at home with tweezers.
5001519~These little citrus-scented cakes cook in just 10 minutes, which means that if you prepare the batter ahead of time and bake them right after the table is cleared, you can serve them warm for an extra-special touch. They're especially delicious dipped into Ginger-Yogurt Mousse with Pistachio Meringue .
5001520~Braised pork shoulder, spicy Italian sausage, and pancetta enrich the tomato sauce. Dried crushed red pepper kicks up the heat.

5014983~These hot and sour pickles are great alongside the spread and frittata , and make a perfect garnish for the Bloody Beers .
5018132~In order to be kosher when served with meat, the risotto in these cakes is dairy-free. It gets its creaminess exclusively from the starchy rice, so it's important to cook it slowly, stirring continuously, to release as much starch as possible.

5011604~This recipe originally accompanied Baja Fish Tacos .

5001538~With sweet potato as a binder, quinoa for protein, and meaty mushrooms for depth, this veggie burger beats anything in the frozen foods aisle.
5001539~Pork loin is a lean, mild cut of meat. I like to add flavor and keep it moist by stuffing it with a mixture of chopped herbs and garlic. Simply make a small channel in the center of the loin with a knife, then poke the stuffing in. The meat will be flavored and basted from within while it roasts.
5001540~Look for rice vinegar in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.
5001541~Richly flavored oxtail cooks down to a fabulously silky texture, but other braising cuts, like bone-in short ribs, would work here too.

5001555~"WHAT: White wine infused with cardamom and star anise, as well as the more traditional triumvirate of cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, and amped up with pear brandy.
HOW: A slice of Asian pear is added to each drink as a garnish—the pear softens slightly as it absorbs the warm booze and makes for a yummy treat once you've sipped the last of the wine.
WHY WE LOVE IT: Like a delicate warm sangria, this drink is the perfect accompaniment to a cozy evening indoors."

5001557~This garlicky, simple seafood dish was once served in a coccio (a traditional clay pot).

5001574~Try this with grilled lamb chops, pork, or chicken.
5001575~Smoked pork shoulder usually isn't available at supermarkets, so you will need to order it in advance from your butcher. If you use ham shanks instead, try to find the kind without artificial flavors like liquid smoke. And don't throw out the cooking liquid; it's great for making soup.
5001576~The spice in this dish from Jennifer Maeng, executive chef at Korean Temple Cuisine in New York City, adds more than taste. A compound found in red-hot pepper may also rev up your metabolism. Wok star!

5016505~This is the stuffing of your dreams, in which everything is a little more rustic, rich, and intense than you remember.
5001583~There's no substitute for the color and pure grape flavor offered by concord grapes. This ultimate fall pie combines concords with juicy pears and a festive top crust. If you'd rather skip the cookie-cutter step, use the second disc of dough to make a double crust.
5001584~"Louise Pickerel of Muskogee, Oklahoma, writes: ""The hot chocolate with coffee and hazelnut liqueurs here is my version of a restaurant recipe. I call it a ""chocolate bar,"" and it does make a nice, lighter alternative to dessert after a filling meal. It's also something good to curl up with in front of the fire."""

5001605~Super-healthy and really light, this beautiful salad is bright-looking and -tasting. These days it's not too difficult to find great-quality raw salmon. If you ask your local market for sushi-grade salmon, its freshness will be guaranteed. Once you have found the salmon, the hard work is done.
5001606~The best way to enjoy this Vietnamese delicacy is first to savor the sauce, shallots, and garlic tucked in and around the shells of the shrimp, then eat the succulent meat with steamed rice. Serve with ice-cold beer or a crisp Viognier or Pinot Gris.

5001629~Fried tofu takes on a meaty texture in this traditional Hunan dish that goes from pleasantly spicy to five-alarm fire in a matter of teaspoons. Pungent fermented beans add a satisfying fragrance to the sauce, perfect for spooning over rice.

5001634~These cozy, warm little desserts are just the sort of thing I like to eat when the weather turns cool. Like most people, I tend to have dessert as an occasional treat, rather than as a regular occurrence; these, however, I find almost impossible to resist. I like to eat them warm and steaming with thick cold cream—and sometimes a spoonful of warm honey, laced with grated lemon and orange zest.
5010691~A mixture of white wine and white wine vinegar, plus a host of spices and vegetables, infuse these shrimp with tangy, fragrant flavor. Serve them as a cocktail party hors d'oeuvre or toss them into a salad.
5015901~Western stocks are loaded with aromatics and many Asian stocks include ginger. This simple stock has a pure chicken flavor.

5009860~This recipe is an accompaniment for Pear-Cranberry Crisp with Cinnamon Ice Cream.
5001640~The chili powder used here can be found in most supermarkets and is made from a blend of spices — it is much milder than pure chile powder from New Mexico, which is very hot. These chicken legs pair nicely with the succotash.

5001646~These sweet potatoes caramelize slightly in the oven, which gives them a sweet crunch as their flesh remains creamy. Lime syrup lends them addictive acid and tart notes, and fresh chives add a faint onion flavor.

5001659~This speedy version of the long-cooked classic is light and brothy, but it's still substantial and flavorful enough — thanks to lamb, kale, and barley — to be a great winter meal.
5001660~Highly recommended!
5001661~"Chef Nancy Oakes was initially underwhelmed when developing this dish. ""The eggs were just poached and a little squishy,"" she says. ""Frying them in breadcrumbs made things more interesting."" For maximum crispiness, chill the poached eggs before giving them a pre-fry roll in the egg whites and panko."
5001662~Try the braised escarole with apples and the herbed spaetzle alongside these juicy chops.

5001667~"""In our family we have a saying that the Greek kitchen is the original twenty-four-hour diner: It never closes,"" writes Georgia I. Chletcos of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. ""The great thing about these home-style dishes is that they're generous to the cook and to everyone else: You don't have to be a pro to prepare them, there's always plenty to share, and you'll have a delicious meal on the table in no time."""
5001668~This is a great meal to help you clean out your fridge. Use whatever veggies you have on hand! A cast-iron skillet will help the rice brown and fry to a crispy coating at the bottom of the dish.
5018328~The sprightly flavors in gremolata, a traditional garnish for osso buco, liven up our Lamb Chops with White Beans and can also add zip to other meats, soups, salads, grains such as rice, or even mashed potatoes.
5001670~Cold soup and hot shrimp—this is a fantastic combination on a warm night. Blending the honeyed sweetness of this summer melon with intensely savory vegetables makes this dish incredibly refreshing. And I give the hot, spicy shrimp a hit of freshness by grilling finely sliced mint right onto them.
5001671~Highly recommended!
5008288~Making chipotle vinegar is about as difficult as making a cup of tea. It is a fantastic tool to have in your repertoire when you want to add acidity with smoke in one easy pour. Use it in your favorite salads or anywhere you want to add smokiness.
5001673~Highly recommended!
5001674~The radicchio delivers nice color, but endive or escarole hearts would be smart substitutions flavorwise.
5001675~Highly recommended!
5017531~A hearty combination of textures and flavors.
5001677~I can’t explain the sudden popularity of this chile sauce. It’s been around since the early twentieth century in Thailand, and has been available in the United States since 1980. The most popular brand in the U.S. is made by Huy Fong Foods, a company that was started by Vietnamese refugee David Tran. He named his company after the ship that brought him out of Vietnam. Also called “rooster sauce” because of the label design, demand has exceeded supply so much that Tran doesn’t need to advertise. If you have jumped on the Sriracha bandwagon, this is the salt for you. Use it on anything that could use a spicy punch— popcorn, fried potatoes, ramen noodles, grilled seafood, and sliced tropical fruits. I like to use a big ﬂaked salt for this one, but it works with any salt you choose.
5001678~Raita is India's signature yogurt and vegetable condiment. This one would also be good on pita or naan.
5001679~The mayo can also be made with dill.
5016368~The Banh Mi, arguably the greatest international sandwich, is easy to replicate at home. Letting the pickled radishes and carrots age a few days strengthens their tang and helps balance the rich pork.
5001681~Serve with crusty French bread for a starter, light lunch, or supper.
5001682~Cutting up a whole chicken is both economical and easy. (For a video of food editor Ian Knauer cutting up a chicken, visit gourmet.com.) Here, the pieces are simply tossed with spices and sweet onion before going into the oven.
5001683~Highly recommended!
5001684~If there's a way to bake a vegetable, trust a Southerner to find it. Who else, pray tell, would steam a head of cauliflower, sauce it, bread it, and bake it? Note: To save time, I nuke the cauliflower, adding no additional liquid. The drops of water clinging to the head after it's washed are quite enough. I simply put the cauliflower in a 2 1/2-quart microwave-safe casserole deep enough to accommodate it, one with a tight-fitting domed lid. I then center the covered casserole in my microwave oven, set the cook-time at 14 minutes, and hit HIGH (full power). My microwave oven is a 650-watter; newer models of higher wattage will do the job faster—perhaps twice as fast. But you will know your particular model's prowess better than I. If you choose to steam the cauliflower instead, allow 8 to 10 minutes in a covered saucepan over moderate heat or until crisp-tender—there should be about 3/4 inch of water in the pan. No steamer rack needed. While the cauliflower cooks, ready the sauce and bread crumb topping. That way no time wasted. Tip: For mellower flavor and smoother sauce, substitute freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for the Cheddar our mothers and grandmothers would have used.
5001685~This dish is a twist on chilaquiles, a tortilla-based hash. It's great served with salsa for breakfast.
5018780~Active time: 10 min Start to finish: 30 min
5001687~Pecan pie dresses up for the holiday. Chocoholics, take note: In addition to the bits of chocolate in the filling, there's cocoa powder in the delicious crust.

5001699~A porterhouse is the perfect steak for two to share because it contains good-sized portions of two of the most prized muscles in a steer, each located on either side of the center bone. The top loin, the larger of the two, is the same piece of gorgeous meat as that steakhouse staple, the New York strip. The tenderloin, attached to the other side of the bone, may be smaller, but it's a much larger portion (technically, it has to be 1 1/4-inches in diameter) than you get in a T-bone steak. If you can find dry aged, try it. It's a bit more expensive but yields more tender and flavorful meat. We pan-roast the steak with the Tuscan stalwarts of garlic, rosemary, and thyme, then serve it with a velvety red wine reduction.
5001700~Highly recommended!
5001701~A classic dish perfected. Ask your butcher to cut the meat from the shank into 3/4-inch cubes.
5004587~The reduction can stand in for some of the beef stock in French onion soup, pot roast, and beef stew, where it will add flavor and richness.
5001703~Panna cotta, a molded chilled dessert popular throughout Italy, is easy to make and can be prepared in advance. It looks and tastes wonderful with ripe red fruits such as raspberries, strawberries, or sweet cherries.

5001709~A fitting way to celebrate the arrival of plum season. Figs, peaches, and hulled strawberries can also be broiled in this manner.

5001715~Digging into these wet nuts is like getting the best part of the ooey-gooey pecan pie: The rich brown butter brings out the nuttiness of the pecans and walnuts, and tangy orange juice helps balance the sweet filling. Serve them over ice cream, with [chocolate mousse] (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/classic-chocolate-mousse-51143870), or with our Build-Your-Own Thanksgiving Pie Bar.

5013318~(Italian Parsley Sauce)
5017326~Editor's note: Chef, nutritionist, and cooking teacher Lourdes Castro shared this recipe from her cookbook, Latin Grilling. It's part of a festive Cuban party menu she created for Epicurious and a great way to use up leftover grilled pork .
5001721~This thick, cheesy dip is delicious with broccoli spears or bread sticks, or even as a spread on slices of bread. Serve any leftovers on baked potatoes or tossed with potato salad.
5001722~This cooling raita, or yogurt sauce, is a popular condiment for Indian feasts. It's also great with lamb chops.
5001723~If you can, buy fresh shrimp with shells and heads still intact. If the heads have been removed, don't worry. Peel the shrimp and use the shells to make shrimp stock. Put the shells (and heads) in a small stockpot. Add 6 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for about 1 hour. Remove from the heat, strain through a fine sieve, and set aside. If you don't have shrimp stock, water can be substituted.

5004505~This fruit butter makes a quick dessert. It's also a great snack on bread or toast. We use it in a low-fat recipe for a moist and chunky apple butter spice cake. We have found preserving in half-pint (250 mL) jars convenient, since that recipe calls for that amount of apple butter. But if you use larger jars, you'll have lots left for other uses.

5001732~"Each year, some fifteen thousand Iowans enter nearly fifty thousand things in competitions at the State Fair. Categories range from draft horses and monster trucks to quilts and corn-cob mosaics. Of course there are pies and cakes, breads and biscuits, jellies and preserves, plus contests for the ugliest cake, the most creative dough sculpture, and things you can do with breakfast cereal. In 1994 Emma Whitlock of Indianola took first prize in the ""Let's Cook Healthy! Iowa Pork"" category. Although this isn't a traditional Fair version of pork tenderloins, it's a simple way to give them a sweet twist."

5001736~"Brandi Neuwirth of Cary, North Carolina, writes: ""My family and I moved here from Los Angeles last year, and my new surroundings have really influenced my cooking. There's a great farmers' market nearby where I get lots of local ingredients. The produce there inspired me to create this dish, which is a real taste of the South."""
5001737~Kale and radicchio both do quite well on the grill; the direct heat turns their edges charred and crispy while the inner leaves become tender and stay intact. Soaking the kale is important so that steam can build and cook through the tough stalks as the leaves grill. Because kale and radicchio are both slightly bitter greens, they take to a sauerkraut-style dressing just as well as cabbage does.

5001744~Begin preparing this a day before serving.
5001745~Oven-drying the tomatoes before baking the tart concentrates their sweetness and prevents juices from softening the filling.
5001746~Serve these hearty meatballs over noodles or mashed potatoes.
5004415~We like to think of the summer roll as an elegant example of fast food: a salad packed into an edible container—in this case, paper-thin rice sheets—which results in something as beautiful to behold as it is practical to eat by hand. Better yet, the summer roll is a big win for the health-conscious because the roll is almost fat-free, and the sauce, while sporting a little peanut butter, is not highly caloric. One dipped bite yields an explosion of flavors and textures that's guaranteed to excite any palate.

5001752~A combination of spicy, tangy and aromatic flavors, this light soup is also really satisfying.
5001753~This is the go-to recipe for knowledgeable brisket lovers. Who then share it with others. Who share it with—perhaps—the Obamas and other notable families. So warm and welcoming, the secret is what Nach did way before anyone else: slice the meat midway through cooking. If you serve this the day after you make it, reheat, covered, for about 1 hour in a 325°F oven.
5001754~Highly recommended!
5001755~These crispy cakes are jazzed up with cayenne and lemon peel. Add purchased potato salad, sliced tomatoes, and a seeded baguette. A strawberry tart from the bakery would make a refreshing summer finish.
5001756~This easy main-course soup is great on its own or with toppings, such as tortilla chips, avocado, and sour cream.
5013551~Homemade beef stock is richer and more flavorful than store-bought, adding lip-smacking depth to your soups, sauces, and braises. Freeze it by the quart and put it to work all winter long.
5001758~Copious amounts of kale were sacrificed in my pursuit of a kale energy bar. On my umpteenth attempt at puréeing the leaves into gooey-green glue, inspiration struck: why not incorporate the kale in crispy kale-chip form? It only took one batch to know I had a winner. The trick to getting great bars is to make sure that the kale is super-crisp, which is a cinch so long as you dry the leaves thoroughly– I'm talking layers of clean dish towels or many turns in the salad spinner, a mere minute or two of effort, before baking. If water remains on the leaves, the kale will steam, not crisp. I don't know about you, but the prospect of steamed kale bars doesnt do it for me. But crispy, toasted seed-enhanced bars? Yes and yes!
5001759~Toasting the pecans before adding them to the filling deepens the flavors in the pie.

5001761~Ancho chile powder gives the meat its southwestern flavor. Chef Purviance suggests serving the brisket with southwestern-style coleslaw (sliced cabbage, jicama, and red onions tossed in a red-wine vinaigrette) and black beans with corn, tomatoes, and chiles. Leftovers would make great sandwiches.

5001765~Forget the mezcal. Use this chile-infused tequila in Margaritas and Palomas—salt-rimmed cocktails made with tequila, lime juice, and grapefruit soda.
5001766~In Thailand, mangoes often appear on the table for dessert — served both on their own and incorporated into a sweetened sticky rice. If you can't get your hands on really good mangoes, you'll find that canned mango purée delivers the best flavor for this ice cream. However, many canned brands taste like peaches, so we recommend Ratna brand, which uses Alphonso mangoes, an Indian cultivar renowned for its bright orange flesh and very intense flavor. Ka-Me brand is a runner-up — the recipe will work fine, but the color and flavor will not be as intense.
5001767~Pears and walnuts are often seen growing side by side in wine-country orchards. They make ideal partners in this delicate, old-fashioned dessert.
5001768~Here, chicken thighs and drumsticks roast on one side of a sheet pan while, on the other, a trio of tomatoes (plum, grape, and sun-dried) intensifies in flavor along with crusty potato and briny olives.

5001773~Long before I discovered my love of sashimi, I fell in love with the viscous, sweet taste of teriyaki. With anywhere from 300 to 700mg of sodium per tablespoon, however, teriyaki chicken from the local takeout is now out of the question. So, to meet my cravings, I let go of the original dish and focused on finding a substitute with a similar color, thick coating, and unique flavor. The low-sodium answer lay in tamarind paste—a sweet and tart concentrate made from tamarind seed pods. It is popular in Indian, Middle Eastern, and East Asian cuisines, and can even be found in Worcestershire sauce. Its acidic properties help tenderize meat, and in Ayurvedic medicine it is said to have heart-protecting properties. Or in Western medicine speak, it may help lower bad cholesterol.
5001774~The dressing is packed with intense flavors, so only a limited amount of oil is necessary.
5001775~In many parts of the country, pierogi, Eastern European dumplings, are sold fresh and frozen in supermarkets. Like premade egg rolls, they've become a convenience food for cooks with limited time. Served with the cabbage and bacon, they're all you need for dinner. These turnovers are typically deep-fried, or boiled and then panfried. Instead, we used a method often employed for cooking frozen Asian dumplings and found it works very well. If pierogi aren't sold in your supermarket, try a local Polish or Eastern European deli.

5001786~The smoked paprika in this recipe adds depth. Unlike Hungarian paprika powder, which is prepared by drying the chiles in the sun, the Spanish smoked version (like La Chinata brand) is prepared by roasting the peppers over smoldering oak fires before being ground to a velvety powder.
5001787~With more flavor than spinach triangles and packed with vitamins, these quickly became such a hit in our house; we like this so much we double the recipe when we make it because no one can eat just one.

5001795~We’ve given this comfort food classic a refreshing spin by serving it over snappy Little Gem lettuce. A double coating of batter helps keep the steak crispy, and a blue cheese-buttermilk dressing offers just enough tang.

5001803~This recipe is extremely simple to make and has a nice peppery flavor from the red pepper flakes, white pepper, and ginger. There is a variety of fresh noodles in the refrigerator section of most Chinese food markets. The best noodles for lo mein are about 1/4 inch thick and are sold in 1-pound packages. If fresh shiitake mushrooms are not available, use button mushrooms. I will sometimes substitute bean sprouts for the Napa cabbage.

5001824~I’d like to clear up any confusion. Dal is not a soup. In fact, there is a dish called dal soup, and it’s different from the dal we’re talking about here. Think of dal as similar in use to gravy—in other words, not a side dish or its own course. It is eaten on rice or with flatbreads, or with dry curries, and vegetables; it is meant as part of a meal.
5014851~Highly recommended!
5001826~I can't think of a better sandwich to take along to the beach, enjoy next to the pool, or keep on hand in the fridge than these wraps. The combination of olives, goat cheese, frisée, and red pepper reminds me of the Mediterranean Sea, making any summer occasion seem slightly more exotic. Thanks to the durable flour tortillas, which can hold alot of heft and moisture without soaking through and tearing, these sandwiches can be made ahead of time.

""My recipe reflects the Caribbean influences in the foods of Miami, where I lived for many years."""
5001831~This dessert has been the grand finale for every type of fancy dinner at Highlands, from museum balls we've catered to family Thanksgiving meals to nightly desserts. Buttery sweet potato filling, sweet coconut, and crunchy pecans combine with a dark rum crème anglaise to make a minor classic. This also pairs well with a cinnamon crème anglaise (see Variation).
5006550~"In our never-ending quest for the best burger, we think we've hit on an outstanding version that requires nothing more than a trip to the supermarket and a short sojourn in the freezer for the bacon. Sure, there are those DIY purists who are going to buy several different beef cuts from a high-end butcherif not butcher the beef themselves from their own grass-fed steerthen coarsely grind it with their own sterilized meat grinder, but most of us just want an easy recipe for a really great backyard burger.
Burger-meisters might be shocked, but this burger does best by being cooked a bit more slowly, over indirect heat. So sit back, pop open a cold one, and let these burgers baste themselves into a sublime place."
5001833~"A creamy ""comfort"" soup that has plenty of richness without a lot of cream."
5001834~Delicate and creamy, these tender individual desserts taste equally good served warm or at room temperature. A spoonful of your favorite jam can be used in place of the glazed rhubarb.
5001835~Highly recommended!
5001836~Crunch-crunch-crunch will end up as munch-munch-munch when this salad is served. Flavor is obviously crucial in food, and certainly this salad has flavor, but tactile sensation is also a very important factor in our food perception and appreciation. We want pasta al dente, celery crunchy, bread grilled. This salad has a lot of texture to enjoy.

5016450~This particularly enticing version of the holiday favorite includes fresh rosemary and thyme along with the spices. The nuts can be made several days in advance and stored in resealable plastic bags in a cool, dry place.
5014860~These irresistible nibbles are at their best served within minutes of deep-frying. If that seems like a little much for Thanksgiving dinner, you can fry them up to 4 hours ahead and warm them up in the broiler or microwave as your guests arrive. You could also serve them at room temperature, though they won't be quite as crispy on the outside and creamy in the center.

Opt for our lemony take on this kid-friendly dessert, or substitute in Key limes, grapefruit, or orange for your own citrus twist.
5001861~Highly recommended!
5001862~I am on a vanilla kick, and it can't be stopped. It should be noted that we are obsessed with malt, brewer's malt, malted milk balls, and the like. These milk shakes are so simple to make, and when we make them, people are always begging us for the secret ingredient. I suppose they aren't used to a malted milk shake anymore. So sad. Also, it makes me bonkers when people ask to use skim milk. It's just not as good, in my humble opinion.
5001863~Thanks to precooked bacon and enhanced bottled dressing, this salad is a snap. For dessert, go all out with brownies à la mode.

5001865~The tang of sour cream gives the illusion that this recipe is not as rich as the cream, butter, and milk would imply.

5001882~This gently sweet ricotta tart provides a creamy base to a rich compote of dried fruit, which includes figs, sour cherries, and apricots (we much prefer the tangy California kind over Turkish). It's much lighter than a cheesecake, but it hits all the right spots. The Miraglia family likes the tart chilled, but we also loved it at room temperature.
5001883~Crusty sourdough rolls and coleslaw made of shredded red and green cabbage tossed with a vinaigrette are nice with the soufflés. Afterward, have a caramel-nut tart from the bakery and cups of herbal tea.
5001884~Nice, being by the sea, offers interesting fish dishes. One of these is poutargue, made with dried and smoked roe, which you will find in some delicatessen shops. The roe should be grated or finely chopped. To every 2 cups add 1 cup chopped hard-cooked egg, 1 cup finely chopped onion, a dash of lemon juice and enough olive oil to blend all.
5001885~Residents of Maghreb use semolina to make tiny pasta pellets called kesksu in Arabic. Unlike pasta made with other types of wheat flour, pasta made from semolina does not become mushy during cooking. The old-fashioned way of making these pellets is to mix semolina flour with water, roll the dough into tiny balls, sift it over a medium-meshed wire sieve to remove any excess flour, then steam the final product over boiling water or a stew. Instant couscous, available at most supermarkets, is prepared by adding boiling water. Although not as fluffy as the classic type, it is more than acceptable for seffa and easy to prepare. Israelis make a larger form of couscous, which is lightly toasted; do not substitute for the regular type.

5001897~Opening a can of tomato paste just to use a tablespoon or two for a recipe can be something of a drain on one's culinary resources—do you ever remember to use the rest of the can? This recipe is the delicious solution. Leftover tomato paste (from our Sausage–Stuffed Potatoes with Green Salad) gets puréed with roasted red peppers, walnuts, and garlic to become a luscious, deeply flavored spread. This easy recipe makes a lot, so it's perfect for a party. And it's so good that it's even worth cracking open a fresh can (it will taste just fine if you use the whole thing).

5001909~In a country known for its fascinating, wide-ranging cuisine, ceviche just may be Peru's national dish. Combinations of sparklingly fresh raw fish marinated in a piquant dressing (often made with ají amarillo and lime juice) are served everywhere, from the lowliest fish shacks to the finest restaurants. For food-safety reasons, we choose to gently poach the scallops, but otherwise, this version, accented by tender sweet-potato cubes, chewy kernels of choclo (a type of Andean corn), and red bell pepper, is entirely classic. Don't forget to drink up the delicious liquid that remains after the ceviche has been eatenPeruvians prize this leche de tigre as a hangover cure.
5001910~Highly recommended!

5001914~We admit we've never been big clafouti fans, but this recipe won us over. It's the lightest version of the dish we've ever had. In the fall and winter, innkeepers Bob and Caroline Taylor like to make this dessert with pears, flavoring it with powdered ginger.

5017688~If you're trying to incorporate more dark leafy greens into your meals, Swiss chard is a great starter vegetable. It cooks quickly compared to kale and collards, and the stems are as delicious as the leaves. In fact, the stems are the prized portion of the plant in Provence, and that's not something kale or collards can brag about.
5001923~Highly recommended!
5001924~The name egg cream is misleading—in actuality, the soda fountain classic contains no eggs and no cream. The three winning elements are milk, flavored syrup, and seltzer. For an icy beverage like top soda jerks used to craft, it's best to frost glasses in the freezer.

5001937~Pudding cakes are little culinary marvels. Take what is basically a thin cake batter, fold in whipped egg whites, put the batter into a baking dish (or several ramekins as I do here), and voilà! As it bakes, the batter separates and forms a sponge cake on the top with a thick, kind of custardy pudding on the bottom. Lemon pudding cakes are common in the South, but I've swapped lemon for Key lime juice.

5001969~The Original: Any old canned tuna mixed with cream of something (chicken, celery, mushroom) soup. Our Version: Oil-packed albacore in a roux-thickened sauce flavored with leeks, dill, and Gruyère. Our one old-school concession? A crunchy, crushed-potato-chip topping.

5001978~Noah: We're always looking for alternatives to pork at Mile End, and this dry-cured lamb breast was an amazing meat discovery for me. You can use lamb bacon in pretty much any dish you'd use standard bacon or pancetta for: Italian peasant soups, potato salads, meat braises, pasta dishes, whatever. We finish our lamb bacon in a smoker, though at home I've cooked it in the oven and gotten great results; it just has a milder flavor. You can store the bacon in the fridge for many weeks.

5001980~For optimum browning, roast this dish in the upper third of your oven.
5015634~Buffalo meat can be very red, even when cooked to medium-rare. Don't be alarmed — this is a naturally occurring phenomenon that has to do with the animal's diet and how little fat is marbled through the muscle. While testing this recipe, we learned that buffalo meat varies in quality; the purveyors whose meat we like best are Wild Idea Buffalo Company (866-658-6137; wildideabuffalo.com), Jackson Hole Buffalo Meat Company (800-543-6328; jhbuffalomeat.com), Arrowhead Buffalo Meats (877-283-2969; arrowheadsteaks.com), and D'Artagnan (800-327-8246; dartagnan.com).

5001992~A staple of classic Japanese cooking, teriyaki is wonderful with not only seafood but also poultry, beef, vegetables, and tofu. Often, however, this versatile sauce can be quite sweet. My version uses fresh orange juice, which adds just a touch of natural sweetness as well as some acidity to temper the sweet mirin. Pouring some of the teriyaki sauce into the hot pan with the fish further reduces it so the sauce really coats the fish with a deep, caramel glaze that enhances the delectable moist, buttery, and tender qualities of black cod perfectly. Other good fish for this dish are Alaskan cod, true cod, sablefish, or wild salmon. Searing each side of the sticky rice cake gives a nutty flavor and crisp texture. I also like to serve these rice cakes with vegetable stir-fries in place of plain rice. If you have a rice cooker, use it to prepare the rice according to the manufacturer's directions. If not, follow the instructions in the recipe to prepare it in a saucepan.
5001993~A creamy white cheddar cheese sauce makes this gratin luxurious enough to serve as a vegetarian main course.

5017350~An easy version of the classic.
5001996~Basil is one of the favorite ingredients of the Italian region of Liguria, and there is no place in the world where it is more fragrant or put to such delicious use. It's the basis of the classic Genoese sauce, pesto, in which it is partnered with garlic, olive oil, pine nuts, and Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses. It shows up most typically floating atop minestrone, drizzled over potato gnocchi, or - as here - tossed with trenette (the local ribbon pasta), potatoes and green beans.
5001997~This simple appetizer is a clever blend of sweet, salty and tangy flavors.

5002027~This dish uses three vegetable-bin staples: onions, celery, and carrots. If you don't have any canned broth on hand, dissolve a bouillon cube in water.
5002028~Golden Delicious apples hold their shape even when baked at a hot temperature and wrapped in puff pastry. Their honeyed flavor adds just the right amount of sweetness to balance these slightly savory turnovers.
5002029~A mix of sweet, smoky, and pleasingly bitter notes gives this crisp, bright salad a modern flair.
5002030~Serve this no-frills feast with cold beer and bowls of melted butter and steaming broth for dipping. The broth cleans the clams, particularly steamers, of any stubborn grains of sand. To serve 4, halve the recipe and divide ingredients equally between two large (8-10 quart) pots.
5002031~The name of this cake derives from the flavors that are reminiscent of the classic mole, an aromatic, delicious chocolaty savory sauce that originated in Pueblo, Mexico. I have always thought that dried chiles were a surprisingly good match for chocolate, and with the addition of canela, cloves, and pumpkin seeds, the full mole flavors emerge. For a shortcut, substitute sectioned grapefruit for the orange caramel.
5002032~You can also make these with chicken, ham or roast pork.
5002033~Fattoush is a Middle Eastern take on panzanella, Italian bread salad. In fact, rustic Italian bread is a good alternative to the pita.
5002034~It's easy to understand why apple crumble pie (sometimes called French apple pie in diners and old cookbooks) is so immensely popular: It packs all the flavor and fragrance of a traditional apple pie underneath a carapace of nutty, buttery, cinnamony crumbs. Adding cranberries to the filling evokes a familiar fall color and provides pleasant tartness to balance the sweetness.
5002035~When you crave something hot and filling, a bowl of this chili will do the trick.

5002051~"The plump ravioli called pansoti (""little bellies""), a Ligurian specialty, are often dressed with a walnut sauce. We strayed from tradition a bit and tucked the walnuts into the filling instead. Be sure to buy pancetta that's well marbled: If it's too lean, it won't render enough fat to flavor the filling. Also, brown the onions well — the caramelization lends a depth and richness that's essential to this dish."
5002398~The bay leaves give a faint flavor akin to allspice, and the cinnamon stick contributes its own subtle note.
5002053~Food editor Andrea Albin, who developed this menu, says that her mom, Veronica, who lives in Houston, should get all the glory here. Raw celery and toasted almonds lace cooked cranberries with terrific crunch.
5002054~Don’t worry if this looks a little runny when it’s hot. The chia seeds will plump as the jam cools, thickening it considerably.
5002055~Folding fruit into guacamole is an inspired tradition in Mexican cooking. Tropical mangoes are a natural pairing, their silky flesh adding a subtle tartness to creamy avocado. To herald the holiday season, pomegranate seeds flash bright red against the guacamoles cilantro-flecked green.

5002074~There's nothing, um, vanilla about our homemade version of the classic. Of course, it also makes a great base for your favorite upgrades.
5002075~If crawfish are hard to find, shrimp make a good stand-in.

5002081~In these stuffed artichokes, based on a recipe by Marie Miraglia — mother of one of our food editors, Gina — the provolone melts into each bite, and the soppressata adds more depth of flavor. Though we've given a regular-pot method in our recipe, there's nothing like the tenderness the leaves acquire in a pressure cooker — and the artichokes are done in a fraction of the time.

5002089~We used veal in the following recipe; however, turkey cutlets (slices of raw turkey breast) would also be delicious and have about half the fat grams.

5002134~Move over boxed mac and cheese; this version is just as simple and a whole lot tastier. The recipe is adapted from the food section of the San Diego Tribune. Pasta in the slow cooker is a bit of a challenge since there must be enough liquid to cook the pasta, but not so much that it will get mushy. We love this recipe because it is the old-fashioned mac and cheese, without a heavy white sauce to make first. The combination of the evaporated milk and egg replaces the flour as the thickener; canned milk does not curdle as fresh milk–based sauces sometimes do. Kids love the macaroni shape, so resist substituting any other shape of pasta. Please note that the pasta goes into the cooker uncooked. This recipe can be doubled and cooked in the large cooker.

5002139~Highly recommended!
5002140~The classic combination of tender pork, tart apples, and cider-braised sweet potatoes is a textbook meal for chilly days, especially when you're really hungry. You'll be amazed how easy it is to pull this hearty meal together; even the cider-based mustard sauce is a snap to prepare.
5008904~This smooth pâté can be set up in small jars for a more festive presentation up to 2 days ahead. A simple wine jelly topping—optional, of course— serves as both a conversation starter and a tart-sweet counterpoint to the rich mousse.
5002142~Try a green salad with Champagne vinaigrette on the side, and some dinner rolls. Serve miniature fruit-filled pastries after.
5002143~Enhance eggs with spinach, which has mounds of magnesium, a mineral that helps keep blood pressure steady.

5002146~Candied, or crystallized, ginger is peeled fresh ginger root that has been cooked in a sugar syrup and coated with sugar.
5017408~This recipe was created to accompany Garbanzo Bean and Potato Fritters with Red Bell Pepper Harissa.
5002148~You'll need a big wok or two skillets to hold this large stir-fry. Here's a recipe where you can put that very dense, baked tofu to good use. Choose tofu that's been flavored with star anise or five-spice powder, available in natural food stores. It has an entirely different texture than fresh—it's quite meaty, actually. I find it tastes best if you slice it thinly and stir-fry it with the ginger and garlic.
5002149~It makes a great side dish, but this salad is even better as a pizza topping. Brush the with olive oil, sprinkle it with sea salt and shredded mozzarella, then bake. When the pizza comes out of the oven, top it with the salad.
5018982~This refined French appetizer is traditionally made by pounding confit of pork, goose, or (in this case) duck into a silky paste. Here a mortar and pestle is replaced by a food processor and elbow grease by a light touch — rillettes are best easily spread but not quite smooth.
5002151~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5002152~This zesty combination makes a lively snack or tasty addition to salads and grain dishes any time of year.

5002157~Whipped cream, fresh lemons and sweet raspberries add homemade flavor to purchased lemon curd.
5002158~Homemade rubs are a quick way to transform roasted meat, poultry, and vegetables into something special. Use this one on both steak and potatoes. Improv: Fennel, cumin, or caraway seeds can replace the coriander; intense, earthy herbs like oregano and sage can stand in for the thyme and rosemary.
5002159~Highly recommended!
5002160~Vichyssoise (pronounced vih-shee-swazh) is a cold potato and leek soup. This version adds the pure flavor of asparagus, along with a hint of mint.

5002164~Equal parts fruit crumble and coffee cake, this not-too-sweet dessert starts out bright pink but bakes to a toasty golden brown.

5002170~This will make more barbecue sauce than you'll need for the chicken. After measuring out basting and serving amounts, save the leftover sauce for another grilling use. It will keep, covered and chilled, 2 weeks.
5002171~This classic New Orleans-style shrimp is dipped in buttermilk then coated in cornmeal before frying for a flavorful crunchy exterior.
5002172~Highly recommended!
5007136~Toss together feathery, pale-green frisée, along with tender, purple-red slices of radicchio, thin semicircles of crisp fennel, and a light mustard vinaigrette to make a gorgeous interplay of colors, textures, and flavors. A generous handful of mint leaves adds a tongue-tingling surprise, reinforcing this salad's zesty freshness.
5002174~From Keo's Thai Cuisine in Honolulu, this recipe calls for marinating pork ribs in coconut milk, lemongrass, ginger and soy sauce overnight. It's a delicious dish.
5002175~Soaking the onion mellows its sharpness. If you can't find fresh horseradish, add 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish to the crème fraîche mixture.
5002176~These fritters are called akara in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and akla or koosé in Ghana. They're eaten as a snack, side dish, or breakfast, served with a hot pepper relish (ata). We think they make a great hors d'oeuvre.
5002177~Highly recommended!
5018392~Beautiful, impressive and filled with flavor.
5002179~Chicken's dark meat is great for grilling because it stays very moist and really soaks up the flavors of a marinade—in this case, an Asian-inspired blend that balances sweet and savory. The addition of meaty mushrooms and bright green baby bok choy makes this a one-dish dinner you can take straight from grill to picnic table.
5002180~Highly recommended!
5002181~If you love sweet and salty paired in one dish, then this nourishing salad is for you. To take this dish on the road, pack the berries and the dressing separately to avoid wilting the greens. For a cocktail party, swap the greens out for lettuce cups and spoon them full of the carrots, radishes, berries, and nuts, then drizzle with dressing.
5002182~Corn kernels and chili powder lend a southwestern accent to these muffins. They would also be nice alongside a bowl of chili.

5002190~Highly recommended!
5002431~This dish — the result of a conversation between two food editors who had just returned from opposite parts of the country — almost made itself. Paul Grimes came back from Charleston talking about the creamy stone-ground grits, shrimp, and collard greens of chef Kevin Johnson at Anson, and Kemp Minifie returned from Seattle to tell us about the scallops over braised cabbage with foie gras vinaigrette that Johnathan Sundstrom serves at Lark. We loved the idea of both dishes so much, we met somewhere in between, with this simpler recipe.
5002192~Last year I made this traditional French country casserole for a Super Bowl party. As a result, my sons will always think of it not as the legendary Languedoc amalgam of beans and meats that has inspired endless recipes, but as the classic Super Bowl gut-buster. They’re right. Cassoulet is peasant food, built to assuage hunger so completely that no amount of labor or hardship could dent the cloud of contentment it generates. And though foodies may argue about authenticity and the precise balance of meat to beans, and whether breadcrumbs belong on top, the truth is, a cassoulet is made from whatever you have on hand. Mine has white beans, lamb, garlic sausage, and smoked sausage (and breadcrumbs), but you can make yours with pork or ham, goat, or duck. Whatever you use, keep the proportions similar to those listed below, and you can’t lose. Go Eagles!
5012857~Heat the pizza stone and prepare the eggplant and other pizza toppings in this recipe while the pizza dough is rising.
5003295~This dish features cabbage and cauliflower prepared simply, to preserve the purity of their flavors. The dates bring out the inherent sweetness of both vegetables perfectly. Make the purées first, then roast the cabbage and cook the chops.
5002195~Great with: Grilled rib-eye steak.
5002196~What the New Sammy's menu describes as a broth is really a purée. The dish is somewhat monochromatic, but its fascinating flavor spectrum will make your mouth extremely happy.
5002197~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002198~There's a southern accent to this entrée, so round out the menu with corn muffins, coleslaw and three-bean salad; then bring on the coconut layer cake.
5002199~Cuban pulled pork—or lechon asado—meets traditional Cuban ham and Swiss sandwiches in these zesty, melty paninis. The pork absorbs loads of flavor while slow cooking in a garlic- and citrus-infused mojo sauce, which ultimately makes for one amazing hot sandwich. Unless you live in south Florida, Cuban bread will probably be rather difficult to come by. So use whatever type of bread tickles your fancy, and if you can’t find a loaf that measures 2 feet (61 cm) long, two smaller loaves (about 12 ounces [340 g] each) of Italian or French bread, or even individual hoagie rolls, would work beautifully instead. Just make sure to start and end your sandwich layers with Swiss, since the cheese is what ends up holding together an otherwise messy panini.

5002202~Wonton wrappers are used for these samosas instead of traditional pastry dough. Betelnut Pejiu Wu in San Francisco serves them with a tropical chutney.
5002203~Avocado pureed with buttermilk (low-fat) and yogurt (with the cream on top) yields a pale green soup laced with masses of minced herbs, textured with cucumber, and garnished with slivered radishes, herbs, and green pistachios. All in all, it's a fine soup for a hot day, and although the recipe makes just a scant quart, it will be enough for four or more servings.
5002204~During Easter time in Ireland, I love to whip up this easy dish for my family. My mom always has three other types of meat in the oven, usually a duck, a goose, and a turkey. Sometimes beef, too. So trying to find the space to make this meat ends up in an annual argument. Every. Single. Time. Just a snippet of Easter with the O’Keeffes.
5002205~The secret to making this dish so stunningly delicious is duck fat. Puréeing the sauce emulsifies the fat, which, along with the moist duck meat, adds an irreplaceable element of richness.
5002206~Pick up some crunchy coleslaw and corn bread to go with the fish. Bourbon-spiked sweetened peaches with vanilla ice cream are a nice dessert.
5002207~Highly recommended!
5002208~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5002210~These delicious sandwiches are from the Corner Bakery Cafe in Chicago.
5002211~Nilou Motamed, Epicurious Editor-in-Chief, swears by this herb-infused lobster roll recipe inspired by her father-in-law Michael DePorte. When available, Nilou prefers soft-shell lobsters, or shedders, for their easy-to-crack shells (no tools required!) and sweet, tender meat. If you choose soft-shell lobsters, reduce the cooking time by 2 to 3 minutes. She also prefers filtered seawater as a cooking liquid, so if your fishmonger has it available, give it a try! Boiling lobsters in well-salted water is the next best thing.
5002212~Butterflying the pork loin isn't difficult, but many butchers will do it for you.
5002213~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002214~Hollowed-out orange halves are filled with mashed yams and topped with marshmallow creme and pecans.
5002215~These healthy sandwiches get a kick from the curry powder. Serve with: Potato chips, red grapes, and a rice wine-marinated cucumber salad.
5014672~An all-butter pastry dough is easy to handle. It's a little less flaky than a dough made with a blend of butter and shortening, but you'll love the end result—it tastes marvelous.
5002217~A strata can be refrigerated overnight before being baked, so it's perfect for entertaining.
5002218~"Pork ribs become satays with built-in ""skewers."" Great as party appetizers, the ribs can be made a day ahead, then grilled or broiled just before you serve them."
5002219~"Francis Butler grew up on the family ranch and continues to preside over the dry, windy land. The lonesomeness of ranch life, she says, was offset by ""group cooks"" such as the annual Thanksgiving tamale making: ""Wild turkey hunting has been a West Texas sport for as long as anybody remembers, and tamale-stuffed turkey may have been an early tip of the hat to the Mexican ranch hands who've been around for at least as long as the turkey. This recipe dates back to the early 1900s. I got it from a family whose grandmother was German but had been raised in Mexico. I make it most often in the cold months, but I've been known to put a tamale-stuffed turkey in the roasting pit in my time, as well. You can use commercial tamales, of course, but I like the two-day ritual of making tamales and then making the turkey. I always double or triple the tamales and freeze the extra. These days people use more barnyard turkey than they do wild. Before you go thinking that's a sorry thing, let me tell you this. You feed your chickens or turkey some chile peppers before you decide. That spicy sweet flavor gets into the meat and you know what they mean when they say it doesn't get any better."""
5014579~"The French often serve flavored wine as an aperitif. This one has a base of red wine infused with orange, lemon, vanilla and cloves; it is later mixed with raspberry brandy and sugar. The drink is best at cool room temperature, accompanied by nibbles such as olives, almonds and crudités. It also makes an excellent Christmas present—just double or triple the recipe, and pour the drink into pretty bottles. Be sure to begin the ""winemaking"" process at least three weeks before you plan to have the wine or give it as a gift."
5002221~Thin green beans add ribbons of color as well as bite to a celeriac rémoulade.
5002222~MOROCCAN COOKS USUALLY MAKE this tasty salad with Swiss chard, but I have seen it also with beet leaves. Eaten all year round, it is prepared by Moroccans on Rosh Hashanah for their Sephardic Seder, when they say a series of blessings over squash, leeks, dates, pomegranates, black-eyed peas, apples, the head of a fish or a lamb, and Swiss chard and beet greens.
5002223~The pasta is divided among four 3 1/2-quart baking dishes so they can be baked individually for open-house-style serving. But you can use any size bake-and-serve dishes — even a roasting pan or a paella pan.
5002224~In this simple, fresh-tasting dish, a crisp coconut coating keeps the fish moist and gives it real island flair. Chef Roxanne Russell grates and dries her own fresh coconut to get long, beautiful strands, but any grated dried coconut will do.
5008949~Nick Malgieri, the director of baking and pastry programs at The Institute of Culinary Education in New York City, created this recipe exclusively for Epicurious. In lieu of a supersweet cream cheese frosting, this recipe contains slightly less sugar, so the tangy cream cheese flavor really sings. We love it, but if you have a sweet tooth, feel free to add up to 1 additional cup of confectioners' sugar.
5002226~Kumquats, small, oval citrus fruit with an edible peel, start turning up in markets this month. They're candied here for a gorgeous cheesecake topping.
5014066~Active time: 45 min Start to finish: 2 1/2 hr
5002228~I was at Palena, my favorite restaurant in Washington, at the end of a meal, when the dessert's taste and texture made me gasp. It was a shallow lemon custard, not just silky but crystal clear in its flavor: a blast of just lemon, cream, and sugar in one bite. Pastry chef Aggie Chin explained that it's her take on a posset, a traditional English dessert in which the cream softly sets with nothing but the help of the acid from the lemon juice. I knew I'd try this at home. It makes the perfect topping for the cookie-crumble crust I like to make, and the perfect base for the fruit I like best with lemons: berries. This can be easily doubled when you'd like to make dessert for two nights in a row, or for you and a friend to share.
5002229~A stunning vegetarian platter.
5019132~Healthy bonus: Vitamin A and lycopene from the red peppers
5002231~Californian Harry Baker invented the chiffon cake in 1927, but he kept the recipe a tightly guarded secret for another 20 years. He finally relented and sold his formula to General Mills. The mystery ingredient? Vegetable oil, which gave the cake richness and a light, moist texture. We spike this one with all the flavors of a Margarita cocktail; the Strawberry Compote with Tequila and Lime is an elegant touch.
5002232~A great partner for some good Champagne. Brown sugar and black pepper make the almonds sweet and spicy.

One from the Soulshakers' greatest hits collection, this drink has been honed to a lethal edge over the past eight years at Gaz's Rocking Blues at London's Notting Hill Carnival and the Glastonbury Festival in southwest England."""
5002239~The name for this flaky pastry comes from the French term for a Venetian blind, which-like the dessert-has slit openings through which one can peek.
5002240~Knowing that every Japanese cook would have strong opinions on the preparation of white rice, Ruggiero counted on her friend Ryuji Inoue, originally from Kyushu, Japan, for guidance. The result is fluffy and slightly stickier than Chinese rice. Even without a rice cooker, the rice comes out just perfect.
5002241~Serve a platter of cookies alongside the pears and ice cream. The night before you make the cookies, place the dried cherries in a small bowl of crème de cassis. The soaking will infuse the fruit with the flavor of the black-currant liqueur.
5002242~Crisp and golden, these juicy pot stickers, stuffed with a classic Cantonese filling, are more than just delicious — they're also a symbol of prosperity for the coming year. Served browned sides up, these pot stickers make for a beautiful presentation.

So pick your favorite filling, or do a mixed batch by making all three fillings and using a third of each amount of the filling ingredients called for below.
We're always experimenting with new flavor combinations, so once you get the basics down, have fun mixing and matching."

5002254~Highly recommended!
5015022~Corn bread sweetened with sugar must be a Yankee invention, because corn bread in the South is always a savory staple. We like to keep it simple, but don't stint on the fat, whether butter or bacon fat (or oil, if you must). Corn bread, corn muffins, and corn sticks should all be cooked to a dark shade of golden brown and turned out while hot, the steam rising fragrant with the aromas of corn and bacon, as you break into them.

5002258~This chutney makes a fine accompaniment to chicken, turkey, and sausage.
5002259~Rajas is the word for a traditional Mexican mixture of sautéed peppers and onions. Green onions work well in this version.
5002260~This dish isn't a makeover, per se. But there are so many beloved— and believe it or not, unhealthy—seared tuna dishes out there in the restaurant world that I thought I should offer at least one healthy version. The tuna is never the problem. Tuna is rich in nutrients, low in fat, delicious, and just a good bet all around. It's the stuff that's put on top that's the problem—anything from seared foie gras to deep-fried tempura crispies. Sure, it tastes great, but those additions turn a healthful dish into an artery-clogging one.
5002261~Juicy sweet cherry tomatoes burst open in warm olive oil, creating a luxuriously silky sauce that comes together in minutes.

5010012~Ras-El-Hanout
5002278~Try any leftover sauce on ice cream.
5002279~This crumble-topped pie stars the flavors of an Old Fashioned cocktail. Our secret weapon: jarred sour cherries (just think of all those cherries you won't have to pit!). We like Trader Joe's Dark Morello Cherries, but other brands work well, too.
5008801~We like to make up a batch of this oil and keep it on hand for seasoning Asian dishes just before serving.
5002281~Highly recommended!
5002282~The texture of these delicate slice-and-bakes is similar to a Mexican wedding cookie: crumbly, but insanely tender.
5013464~"This sublime lemon dessert is the perfect antidote to all those chocolate bunnies and chocolate-stuffed eggs proliferating at Easter like, well…rabbits. It helps that our pudding is simple to make, too.
A seriously tart lemon curd—quickly cooked on top of the stove—is folded into sweetened whipped cream, which both tempers the tang and lightens the dessert with a suave silkiness. Crisp, airy wisps of meringue, lightly sprinkled with chopped pistachios and easily shaped and baked into cigars, are delightful on their own, but they're surprisingly efficient alternatives to spoons for delivering the pudding to your mouth."

5002285~Highly recommended!
5002286~Gianduia, the classic Italian combination of hazelnuts and chocolate, is never more appropriate than in fall, when the hazelnuts are harvested throughout Piedmont. Here the mixture is showcased in a soft, simple pudding, spiked with hazelnut liqueur and sprinkled with toasted hazelnuts.
5002287~Often called black cakes, spice cakes flavored with molasses are a perennial on the southern dessert buffet.

5016823~Inspired by the cooking of the American South—and absolutely delicious.
5002712~You would never guess that this dense and creamy dessert is nondairy and kosher for Passover. Since the recipe contains egg yolks, this is not a sorbet in the strict sense, but the yolks do provide a rich texture.
5010942~If you want to make the scallions but not the rest of the menu (Grilled Pork Kebabs with Ginger Molasses Barbecue Sauce), see recipe for creamed grilled corn for instructions on preparing a charcoal grill.

5002301~Hot, stuffed phyllo shapes called briouats are delectable appetizers. Folded into small triangles, cigar-shaped cylinders, or even rectangles, they come with an array of fillings, from spiced ground kefta to sweet milky rice. My favorite is this one with fresh unsalted cheese called jben—especially with a brushing of honey to give the crispy rolls a pleasing sweetness. Alternatively, dust the fried briouats with powdered sugar and cinnamon.
5018458~This recipe is an accompaniment for Wild Mushroom Pizza with Caramelized Onions, Fontina, and Rosemary .
5002303~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002304~Flavored vinegars can be used to enliven dressings and marinades, finish pan sauces, or pickle vegetables--and they make wonderful gifts. Once the steeping is completed, these vinegars keep for several months. (Garnishes and other solids left in the jar, however, may discolor or break down.)
5019082~Chef Anne-Sophie Pic serves this chutney, topped with a skewer of rabbit liver and kidney, alongside the Savory Rosemary Shortbreads . We recommend pairing it with steak, lamb, pork, or a full-flavored fish such as salmon, bluefish, or mackerel.

5003506~Let the yogurt work its marinade magic overnight in this stunning main course. Look for a small butterflied boneless leg of lamb at your supermarket, or ask your butcher to butterfly one for you.
5002321~There's marrow in those bones! Scoop out the cooked marrow and whisk it into the braising liquid, or eat it on a crust of bread with salt. You earned it.
5011185~Don't think of toasted pumpkin seeds merely as a topping for the Risotto with Tuscan Kale — they also make a terrific hors d'oeuvre or snack.<
5002323~Tofu is a surprisingly rich source of calcium, which may discourage your body from storing fat, especially in the tummy region. Break out the bikini!

5002334~This impressive side dish is a play on the classic twice-baked potato with amped-up toppings of Parmesan whipped cream, candied hazelnut-bacon bits, and fresh chives.
5002335~Even those who prefer their tuna raw or quickly seared will be won over by this preparation. Marinated in a savory anchovy-lemon dressing, the tuna steaks are cooked until their centers are pale pink but still quite juicy. The bold flavors continue in the colorful sauce of briefly cooked tomatoes, black olives, capers, celery, and basil.
5002336~Essentially, these are old-fashioned sugar cookies all dressed up for the holidays. If you want to use icing for decoration, follow the directions for the icing in the New England Molasses Gingerbread Cookies recipe.

5002343~To most Americans, Ischia, off the coast of Naples, is relatively unknown. That's a shame, because for centuries this island's thermal springs have been luring savvy travelers for restorative dips; plus, the locals produce some of the best wine in the region. At La Pergola, a family-run inn located on a hill just outside of Forio, guests enjoy some of that homemade wine, along with artisanal jams and olive oil. La Pergola also serves one of the island's most popular dishes, rabbit cacciatore, or hunter's rabbit.
5002344~This recipe comes from New York chef Deuki Hong's father and has origins in North Korea, the ancestral home of mandu. (Sharing a border with China, it is no coincidence that mandu sounds a lot like the Chinese word for steamed bread, mantou.) Unlike versions stuffed with finely chopped kimchi, Deuki grew up eating mandu with kimchi on the side. The star in this recipe is the very generous quantity of butter, which is mixed in with the pork, garlic and ginger and adds a real-deal richness to each bite. Not typically used in East Asian cooking, butter is a fully Americanized, fully awesome way to rethink the mandu.
5002345~This is a traditional homemade drink that's found all across West Africa. It's sometimes called ginger beer, though it's not alcoholic.

5002349~This Asian-inspired recipe contains ground pork and a velvety peanut sauce (made with the very same peanut butter that you use to make PB&J sandwiches when no one's looking) accentuated with sharp ginger, lime juice, and fresh herbs.

5018484~Everyone wants the juiciest turkey possible for Thanksgiving, and we find that brined or kosher turkeys are best for this. If you'd like to try brining, stir together 8 quarts water with 2 cups kosher salt in a 5-gallon bucket lined with a large heavy-duty plastic garbage bag, then soak raw turkey, covered and chilled, 10 hours. (Kosher turkeys, which are salted during the koshering process, are just as succulent and flavorful as brined ones.) If you are making this entire menu in a single oven, bake the stuffing and sweet potatoes and reheat the potato parsnip purée while the turkey stands after roasting.
5002356~Norwegian men have taken to cooking for fun, and this excellent luncheon entrée is from Derek Blixen, manager of the Pan American World Airways Oslo office.
5002357~Set out a plate of these sweetly spiced cookies and watch them vanish fast.
5016659~This is a great frosting for the Carrot Cake . The lemon zest complements the cream cheese so perfectly that I sometimes even snack on this frosting—I just can't get enough of the sweet, tangy flavor! If you want extra oomph on the Carrot Cake, add minced ginger to the lemon zest.
5002359~Transform sweet potatoes into caramelized beauties by cooking them with rice wine and honey. Serve them alongside roast duck or pork chops.

5002363~"People—not just the Irish—have been eating blood puddings for centuries, in cultures all around the world. No Irish fry is truly complete without at least a slice of black and a slice of white pudding. And it's not just for breakfast anymore. Talented Irish chefs have found ways to incorporate it into salads and main dishes. Black pudding recipe vary wildly throughout Ireland; some include barley, breadcrumbs, and flour, but oatmeal is the old-fashioned thickener. Be sure it's steel-cut or pinhead oatmeal, and cook it until just tender. Individual nubs of oats should be visible in the final product. Store-bought versions will always be made in sausage casings, unlike this recipe, packed into a loaf pan.
It is far easier to buy black pudding ready-made, and there are lots of artisan producers making truly worthy black versions. But if you're able to come into possession of fresh pig's blood, you'll be all set to make this recipe. And if not—well, you'll know precisely what a good black pudding should contain."
5002364~Progression of a tomato sandwich: On buttered bread with salt; on bread with mayo and cheddar; seasoned and grilled with cheddar and mayo. They’re all pretty perfect, but we’ll take the advanced version, thanks.

5002366~Delicious with crudités, this dip is also quite good as a topper for chicken or fish.
5002367~Ingredients of Sephardic cooking—dates, cardamom, and orange zest—bring a mosaic of Mediterranean scents and textures to the Passover table. The cake has a coarse crumb yet is incredibly moist and chewy, thanks to the dates. A sprinkle of our Passover version of powdered sugar dresses up the torte for a special occasion.

Here, Prosecco (the Italian bubbly) stands in for the Champagne, and peach nectar and liqueur are used instead of crème de cassis.

5018517~I think we all play favorites in the kitchen; I know I do. One day I am all over my Tahini-Lemon-Yogurt Dressing, dreaming up salads and dishes that would marry well with its salty tang. Then, suddenly, I abandon it in favor of another dressing and another direction. At this writing, this is my most loved dressing, and I drizzle it on everything I can get my hands on!
5002391~This salsa is chock-full of sun-loving ingredients like tomatoes, olives and capers. It's a splendid accompaniment to grilled halibut steaks, pork chops, sliced eggplant or sourdough bread.
5002392~In this dish, inspired by Cuban cooking, hints of clove and cinnamon whisk a standby cowboy steak to the Caribbean.
5002393~Serve the roast beef and the mayonnaise on their own, or put assorted breads alongside so that guests can make little sandwiches.
5006862~Because of its shape, orzo can do nearly anything rice can do, and if youre a pasta lover, you might say orzo does it better. Saffron and fennel are two characteristic flavors in many Mediterranean dishes.
5002395~This dish makes delicious use of the warm spices prevalent throughout island cooking. The chicken needs time to marinate, so start the recipe ahead.

5004744~Highly recommended!
5002398~The bay leaves give a faint flavor akin to allspice, and the cinnamon stick contributes its own subtle note.
5002399~This is a rich yet exquisitely simple dish that can be at its best only if every ingredient is of top quality. The asparagus must be fresh and in season, brightly colored, and crisp, with almost a glow in the center of the stalk. If you can buy butter from Normandy, use it; for Parmesan, use only Parmigiano-Reggiano, with its full, ripe flavor. The asparagus is not actually rôtie, or roasted, but rather sautéed in butter until it has a gilded, roasted appearance. The sprinkling of chopped raw asparagus at the end adds crunch and a slightly nutty taste to a dish of silken textures and flavors.
5002400~This dessert can be made one day ahead and stored in the freezer, making it ideal for entertaining. You can create the decorative meringue swirls and peaks with a rubber spatula, table knife, or spoon, but an offset spatula works best.
5005081~This ragù would also be excellent served over instant polenta instead of pasta.
5002402~The garlicky spread that tops this steak is also excellent on fish, chicken, and pasta. Make extra and freeze it for a super finish for future weeknight dinners.
5004426~With its use of dried porcini in the turkey rub and fresh shiitakes in the light gravy, this recipe from the late food writer Michael McLaughlin is a fine example of his signature style: deeply flavorful seasonal cooking. You can make the turkey stock for the gravy up to two days ahead.

5002460~Do you love apple pie, but feel stuck in a classic-pie rut at Thanksgiving? Bake outside the box this year with the Italian version, known as crostata. Unlike typical American pie pastry, crostata pastry is similar to cookie dough, so instead of being flaky, it bakes up like a crisp, chewy sugar cookie. Drizzle slices with warm spiced caramel sauce, and you just might count yourself among the crostata converts.

5002425~Round out this menu with a salad of snow peas, cherry tomatoes, and bean sprouts dressed with a rice-wine vinaigrette. For dessert, sliced kiwis splashed with rum would be good.

5006762~"When food editor Shelley Wiseman was asked to develop a recipe for an over-the-top turkey, she began by rubbing truffle butter under its skin. ""Its a cheap shot,"" she admitted, ""but its damn delicious."" We all agreed—its the best turkey most of us have ever tasted. The butter, an excellent carrier of that unmistakable truffle flavor, moistens the turkeys meat and crisps its skin during a high-heat roast. For this splendid centerpiece, a nuanced French shallot-wine sauce is just the thing."

5002431~This dish — the result of a conversation between two food editors who had just returned from opposite parts of the country — almost made itself. Paul Grimes came back from Charleston talking about the creamy stone-ground grits, shrimp, and collard greens of chef Kevin Johnson at Anson, and Kemp Minifie returned from Seattle to tell us about the scallops over braised cabbage with foie gras vinaigrette that Johnathan Sundstrom serves at Lark. We loved the idea of both dishes so much, we met somewhere in between, with this simpler recipe.
5002432~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002433~Cheese production increased in the nineteenth century when dairy cooperatives were formed in Minnesota and Wisconsin; now, that area of the country is known for making outstanding cheese. In this recipe, white cheddar goes into a rich and creamy potato gratin that is a great substitute for — or, at a particularly lavish feast, a fine accompaniment to — mashed potatoes.
5002434~Highly recommended!
5002435~"As Gourmet wrote in 1959: ""Long ago...it did occur to some blithe spirit, a poet of the kitchen to be sure, that when these little veal rolls were arranged on a platter they looked like a flock of headless birds. And oiseaux sans têtes, or veal birds, they remain to this day in the cuisines of such diverse countries as Belgium, Italy, and France."
5002436~The delicate beet greens — which are an excellent source of potassium, folic acid, and magnesium — make this dish even more healthful.
5002437~This creamy rice, fragrant with lemon, makes a nice accompaniment to veal. If you like, pack the rice into half-cup custard cups and unmold onto the serving plates. Garnish with additional snipped chives, if desired.

5002441~"The classic farmstand treat gets a double dose of cider goodness from a reduced cider ""syrup"" that is both mixed into the dough and used as the base for the shiny glaze."
5002442~Slow-roasting at a very low temperature results in extremely tender salmon. The richness of the fish is accented by a salty-sweet red-wine sauce, which thickens into a syrupy glaze during cooking.
5002443~"Spring rolls are the quintessential Asian appetizer, but I have adapted the concept to dessert. When cooked, these rolls are like cylindrical molten cakes with warm chocolate oozing out of an impossibly thin and crisp ""pastry"" shell. The kumquats not only cut through the richness with their distinct citrus tartness, but also are a symbol of good fortune, as kum is a homonym for ""gold"" in Chinese."

5014497~This is one of my mother's recipes and call me biased, but it's the best around. This is a vegetarian black bean soup, and one of the keys to its success is the quality of the olive oil: use the very best you can find. You can make the soup a day in advance and it will taste even better the next day. This is a no-fail recipe that I know you're going to enjoy.
5002480~Removing the typical cucumber from tabbouleh leaves plenty of room for fresh honeydew or any cool, sweet melon in this summer-inspired departure.
5009020~"The French have a saying, ""You must watch what you're cooking like milk on the stove,"" referring, of course, to the fact that milk can boil over in a flash.

5002486~Top with chopped fresh cilantro, red onions, and grated cheddar cheese, if you like.
5002487~Surely you've had one too many supersweet sangrias whose fruit chunks overpower the (usually mediocre) wine. This version couldn't be more of a contrast, with a refreshing mintiness and subtly aromatic fruit that still allow the crispness of the white wine to come through.
5002488~Stout, in the sharper-flavored ale family of brews popular in Great Britain, gains its dark color from the roasted malt used in its brewing. The rich, malty flavor melds well with the molasses and aromatics in this moist cake, which is brightened with a lemon glaze.
5002489~"The battle of Most Iconic Hotdish would probably come down to Tater Tot versus wild rice, which is kind of like arguing over which Matthew McConaughey role is the most definitive, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days? Or Dallas Buyers Club? Tater Tot hotdish is typically ground beef, creamed soup (often mushroom), some sort of vegetable (probably peas or green beans, maybe some corn), and then, in the words of Sam Sifton, ""You cover the bitch with Tater Tots."" But you don’t just throw them on like an abstract topping, you have to let your OCD hang out a little and organize them in rows and columns, as neatly as possible. This organizing of the tots might be one of the most sacred food rituals in the Midwest, second only to making lefse. My Tater Tot hotdish has the body of a chicken pot pie, a dish that I loved growing up, long before I knew the existence of Tater Tot hotdish. But a close examination reveals that the only real differences are the subbing of chicken for ground beef and the use of a homemade cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom soup. I don’t think this will offend a hotdish purist."

5002491~To make this dish especially fast and easy to prepare, you can use store-bought roasted peppers.
5002492~Be sure to use fresh ricotta cheese from an Italian market — authentic ricotta has the rich, dense texture that's best for this recipe. Make the rolls one day ahead so the flavors can develop. Serve with marinara sauce for dipping.
5002493~Splash liberally on fried eggs, toss with grilled veg, or spread on a sub.

5002495~You'll want generous scoops of tangy richness with both the honey caramel peach pie and the plum-blackberry streusel pie , or all by itself. The ice cream is as blissful to prepare as it is to eat: Just purée everything in a blender, then freeze in an ice cream maker.
5002496~Fennel pollen, a relatively new spice here in America, is very popular in Italy. It is more subtle and delicate than fennel seeds, and it marries particularly well with pork. If you can't find fennel pollen, substitute freshly ground fennel seeds.
5002497~Use this dressing on crisp lettuce or omit the buttermilk and serve it as a dip with crudités.

5010834~You can make this stock with a variety of fish carcasses (from nonoily fish) or with just one type — whatever your seafood market can give you. This recipe makes more stock than you'll need for the fideos with mussels , but leftovers can be frozen and used for soups, stews, and sauces.

5002515~Baking citrus at a high heat caramelizes the sugars and adds depth. It's just the thing to bring intrigue to salads and more.
5002516~Though we can appreciate the beauty of a panna cotta that's been turned out of its mold, the light-as-air texture of these, just set enough to melt in the mouth, will have you happy to eat them right from the cup. Yogurt gives the almond-infused cream a little tang, and peaches that have been macerated with lemon thyme just long enough to meld and soften seem to exist expressly for this dessert.
5002517~Aromatic without being spicy, this dish has a touch of the exotic but will please traditionalists, too. The spice paste hits on sweet, hot, salty, and sour, and the lamb is wonderfully tender.
5002518~Highly recommended!
5002519~The rice-shaped pasta orzo is sometimes labeled riso or rosamarina.
5002520~Cranberries mixed with sugar and citrus are perfectly fine for turkey, but pork needs something a little different. Here, the tart quality of the cranberries is underlined by the horseradish, and together they enhance the sweet, sturdy nature of roast pork.
5002521~This stew calls for water instead of stock to be added. The pork shoulder will create a rich cooking liquid on its own.
5002522~Highly recommended!
5002523~Highly recommended!
5002524~It's the possibilities in that blank crust that make pizza so much fun. Lately, we've been obsessed with white pizza. Brush the dough with olive oil, sprinkle with mozzarella, and then let the fun begin. Without the acidity of the tomato sauce to contend with, you can really experiment. In this version, asparagus adds freshness and a hit of color, goat cheese brings a creamy tang, and fingerling potatoes (yes, potatoes) round out the pie with their richness.
5002525~Polenta is layered with Fontina cheese and cream in this decadent casserole. Offer it with the sausages and tomato sauce, or on its own as a brunch or lunch dish.
5002526~Highly recommended!
5002527~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from Irish Traditional Cooking by Darina Allen.
5002528~Just right for breakfast on the go, these muffins are subtly spiced, fluffy, and speckled with plenty of golden raisins.
5002529~The delicate sweetness of Alaskan king crab is front and center in this easy-to-make appetizer. The crab legs come already cooked and need only be cracked to extract the pink-flecked succulent meat.

5002534~The Japanese are wild about pickles, pickling practically every vegetable and root they come across—and in sweet, salty, sour, and bitter incarnations to boot. In this classic, a hit of wasabi powder adds a subtle heat to these savory quick pickles.
5002535~Orange peel and juice can be substituted.

5002538~A spinach salad with cherry tomatoes, toasted walnuts and lemon vinaigrette is a fine accompaniment, along with potato salad from the deli. Buy a fresh peach pie, and you're all set.

5002543~THE GOODS This toasty twist on oatmeal will make you smile. Oats' B vitamins trigger production of mood-sweetening serotonin (454 calories per serving).
5002544~Serve as an entrée with salad and wine, or as a side dish with steak, ham or roast beef.
5002545~Fava beans most likely require a trip to a farmers’ market and take a while to peel. Sugar snap peas cut into bite-size pieces are a fine alternative.
5002546~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less, but requires additional unattended time.
5002547~For more information about cooking wild rice, see Born to Be Wild.
5002548~The robust sauce doubles as a marinade for this easy and elegant entrée. Begin preparing well before serving so that the pork has time to marinate. Accompany with boiled green beans and a full-bodied Zinfandel.
5012069~Similar to pumpkin pie, but not quite as sweet. Serve with whipped cream, if you like.
5002550~Forget S'mores. This summer, we're making these sweet grilled sandwiches.

5002562~To form the noodle cakes, measure them out by taking a few strands of noodles and loosely squiggling them into a tablespoon. Once you get the hang of the amount needed, you can pretty much eyeball it.
5018447~Roasting the turkey and vegetables before simmering them results in a dark stock that takes you more than halfway to a rich brown gravy. The recipe yields enough for the gravy and then some, but you'll be happy to have the extra when it comes time to make soup.
5002564~Hold the mayo: This rustic side dish is dressed with a Provence-inspired blend of white wine, Dijon mustard and capers. Be sure the potatoes are still warm when you add them to the dressing; they’ll absorb it better, enhancing the flavor of the dish.
5002565~Highly recommended!
5002566~Even easier: Buy fresh pineapple that's already been peeled.
5002567~This simple recipe did not take the blue ribbon at any barbecue contest. It did come in third—by 2 points…in the Anything Butt Brisket category. In that category, you could barbecue anything but brisket and sirloin. Chef Paul chose to do beef short ribs, and almost everybody said he didn't have a chance of winning or even placing because he was going up against beef tenderloin, rib-eyes, T-bones, and porterhouse steaks. What did they know?!
5019962~Highly recommended!
5008786~Extra milk makes these potatoes silky-smooth, and truffle oil adds luxurious flavor.
5002570~Chef Sean Brock created this dish using quail, but the technique pairs equally well with bone-in turkey breast, creating a surprisingly juicy version of a much-maligned cut. Searing a turkey breast on the stovetop crisps the skin beautifully, while basting with thyme- and garlic-scented duck fat enriches the lean meat. Green onions stand in for the green garlic for a silky, fresh sauce that's a welcome departure from classic gravy. Be sure to use homemade vegetable stock or a clear canned stock to preserve the brilliant green color. You can find duck fat from many gourmet shops, or online from D'Artagnan.
5002571~An easy side dish that goes great with Peppered Beef slices with Green Onions and Radishes .
5002572~If you have leftover roast chicken or turkey, use it here and save a step. You'll need 3 cups of shredded meat.
5002573~Gremolata is traditionally made with chopped garlic, parsley, and lemon peel; this one incorporates chopped hazelnuts and uses orange peel instead of lemon.

5002587~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002588~Chef Susan Goss says that the secret here is in her cast-iron skillet. Nonstick pans produce anemic, soft corn bread. This recipe also works well with corn-stick or muffin molds, as long as they’re well-seasoned cast iron. If your pan is hot enough, the batter will immediately rise and start to cook around the edges. (The restaurant’s skillets rarely leave the oven.)
5002589~For a milder dish, use fewer Thai chiles and seed the serranos before mincing them.
5002590~Lemon brightens the sweet tang of buttermilk in this dairy-state specialty.

5002597~This delicious tweak on a classic is from Hip Sips by Lucy Brennan (Chronicle Books, Spring 2007) and was featured as a Cocktail of the Month.
5002598~The trick to making great challah is to add just enough eggs and oil to the dough so that it tastes rich and moist without becoming heavy and sticky. My friend Kathy Cohen gets it exactly right—her bread, stuffed with apples, raisins, and cinnamon, is the highlight of her annual Jewish New Year feast. For years, I'd count the days between slices, until I finally decided to ask for the recipe.
5002599~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002600~Roasted vegetables and Italian Fontina lend this lush-tasting lasagne a more intense flavor than than you'd get with the usual spinach and ricotta filling.
5002601~At the fish market, ask them to remove the head, tail and bones from the trout, then to cut each trout into two fillets, leaving the skin intact.
5002602~The synthesis of fresh and longcooked textures; rich, sweet, and herbal flavors; and juicy and crunchy garnishes. Serve with extra herbs, chiles, and lime so everyone can customize his own bowl.
5002603~The combination of tuna and olives is reminiscent of a salade niçoise.
5002604~You might like to double up the ingredients here, because this is effectively two meals in one. You start by making a wonderful, rich mushroom risotto, which you could serve warm one night (perhaps finished with a drizzle of olive oil), and then you could make these rice balls for the following evening. They are perfect with a glass of prosecco (or champagne if you haven't really gotten the hang of this economizing business).

5002621~Frozen yogurt! I mean let's face it: Everybody loves a good frozen yogurt. Adults, tweens, teens, kids, whoever. You've seen it a hundred times at your local ice cream parlor on Sunday in the summer: 9:00 p.m. and the place is packed! A line around the corner, kids playing, everybody's happy; it's the sweet life. For a diabetic, that could go two ways: One way is horribly wrong, and that's if there're no sugar-free items on the board. Or, totally great because they do offer some special items for people with some sort of dietary restriction. Or there's Plan C, which is that you make a batch of this silky, creamy, coconut yogurt at home and relax with the fam on Sunday night. Let the others rush to the corner store and wait in line; your only fear will be whether or not your family leaves you any.
5002622~Feel-good food: New research shows the vitamin C in acorn squash may help boost your mood.
5002623~To sauté pork tenderloins, cut them into rounds (noisettes) about 3/4 inch thick, brown them over high heat, and then continue cooking them until they are firm to the touch.

The anchovy pasta and the ricotta and mascarpone cream puffs here are perfect examples."""

5002647~These chewy oatmeal cookies are spicy with ginger and not too sweet. Look for candied ginger that's cut into cubes and is not dusted with sugar — it'll be more tender and easier to chop.
5002648~The twist to these sundaes is a simple ginger-flavored sauce sparked with lime. It can be made ahead and rewarmed before you assemble the sundaes.
5013708~"We offer so many mouthwatering buttery, sugary, fruity, chocolaty sweet breakfast treats in the morning that it can be almost impossible to choose just one (""I'll have one of each"" is a common humorous request from new customers). That is, unless you're one of those people who need to start off the day with eggs or bacon or anything not sweet. For those customers, we've created the ultimate quick grab-'n'-go breakfast using items we already have in-house: brioche dough, cheese, breakfast meats, and eggs. The dough, after an overnight rest in the refrigerator during which it develops flavor, is stretched and pulled like you would a pizza dough to make a flat round."
5002650~Thanks to frozen puff pastry, making this savory hors d'oeuvre is a snap.
5002651~This heirloom family recipe has the distinctive allspice aroma of the cooking of my hometown, Santiago de Cuba, the only part of Cuba where this complex spice is used in a pork marinade.

5002658~Guam has a hyperactive barbecue scene, with an annual festival that gives away tens of thousands of dollars in prize money. No family or social event is complete without the firing up of a grill (often half of a 55-gallon drum). Given Guam's proximity to the Philippines and Japan, it comes as no surprise that soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi should figure prominently in the local grilling. Here's the Pacific Island version of a grilled blackened tuna from my Guamanian barbecue buddy, Steven Cruz. The tuna is crusted with Old Bay seasoning. (OK, it's a long way from Baltimore to Guam, but apparently this Maryland seafood seasoning enjoys great popularity on the island.) Ginger, wasabi, and chiles give the dipping sauce a triple blast of heat.
5002659~This innovative and refreshing dish is just right for warm weather parties. Use only one variety of melons or an assortment, but be sure they are the ripest available.

5002693~"I met twelve-year-old Frank Liranzo when I was teaching a kids' cooking class at the YMCA's environmental camp in Huguenot, New York. The kids learned how to tap trees to make maple syrup, a process I'd read about but never seen in action. Frank was one of the campers, and he got to experience firsthand the old art of making maple syrup. ""You put tubes into the trees so the sap flows out,"" he says. ""When it first comes out of the tree, it tastes like sugary water. Then we went to the sugar shack where we saw the sap boiled down until it tasted like syrup."" At the camp, I made this Maple-Glazed Tuna with Pear-Potato Salad for the kids. ""I thought it would taste really sugary, but it didn't,"" Frank told me. ""First I tasted the fish, then a hint of mustard, and then an aftertaste of the maple syrup."" I love how the syrup adds sweetness and a beautiful caramelized crust to the meaty tuna steaks, while the sweetness of the pears in the accompanying potato salad balances nicely with the glazed tuna."
5002694~This Franco-American combination of bourbon and bubbles gives you another reason to be thankful. It doubles easily to accommodate the number of guests around your holiday table.
5002695~For the Mediterranean's Sephardic Jews, sweet fried pastries are as strong a tradition as potato latkes are for Eastern Europe's Ashkenazic Jews. The version here is distinctive for the addition of raisins and pine nuts, inspired by a Roman recipe.
5002696~"If I had to pick one dish that exemplifies ""Hazan family favorites,"" it would be this sauce. It is ridiculously simple. You put four ingredients into a pot and place it on the stove. The onion is just peeled and cut in half, no chopping or slicing required. And if you are using canned tomatoes, all you do is open the can, pour it in the pot, and break up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon. But it's not because of how easy it is that it's a favorite; it's because the flavor is addictively delicious. At our cooking school in Italy we offer a ""level-two"" course for those who want to return for more. I always ask what dish from the first course is their favorite. Out of a week of classes and restaurant meals, the majority say it is this sauce that they remember best. As an added bonus, it can be frozen and will taste just as good when thawed and reheated months later. If you do make a larger batch, be aware that the cooking time will increase."
5002697~Highly recommended!
5014264~The ultimate comforting supper, bursting with flavorsome vegetables and a rich herby gravy. You can either use some of the pre-frozen chicken filling , in which case thaw it, then assemble the pie and eat straight away.

5002715~We've substituted the florets of regular broccoli for broccoli rabe, since they are more readily available. Use rabe if you can find it at your market; it will lend a stronger, more authentic flavor to the dish.
5002716~Simmered and later sauced in a lemony olive oil spiced with fennel and coriander seeds, artichokes absorb a complex blend of gorgeous flavors. The tender, juicy hearts bronze in a hot skillet just before serving, adding depth to this delicate dish.
5019052~For a more colorful presentation of this down-home dip, we reserved some bacon, bell pepper, scallions, and basil for garnish.

5002721~For centuries, the French have been braising duck as a way to tenderize it, whether the duck was wild or tame (use only farm-raised duck in the recipe below). The slight bitterness of turnips nicely offsets the flavorful meat rich but simple sauce. The appropriate wine choice here would be French-splurge a bit for the season and pour a good Burgundy or Chablis with this.

5002764~"The technique: When it comes to poultry, butterflying means removing the backbone and flattening the bird like a book. This is easy enough to do with a chicken, but we suggest asking your butcher to butterfly the turkey.
The payoff: A flattened turkey cooks more evenly and quickly than a regular bird. Tucking the stuffing under the skin ensures that the meat will be moist and delicious.

5014409~Tempered chocolate has a shiny, flawless appearance. It feels firm and breaks off with a snap when you bite into it and it melts smoothly in your mouth, allowing you to fully enjoy the flavor. Slowly heating and cooling melted chocolate while stirring puts it into temper. If chocolate is not tempered properly, the cocoa butter crystallization is uncontrolled and uneven, which results in an unattractive chocolate that is dull or has white streaks running through it. Untempered chocolate may feel rough or tacky and have a cakey, almost chewy texture. And it is more susceptible to heat and humidity, melting more easily and spoiling more quickly. Some simple candy recipes do not require tempered chocolate. However, candies such as truffles, dipped chocolates, and chocolate bars require tempering to achieve their signature appearance, taste, and texture.

5002771~Highly recommended!
5002772~If there were ever a love song to garlic, Lebanese toum (pronounced TOOM) is the finest aria of them all. Toum, which means “garlic” in Arabic, is pure garlic flavor that is brightened with lemon; you’ll find yourself stirring toum into just about any recipe that calls for minced garlic, as well as its classic Lebanese pairing with grilled meats such as Yogurt Marinated Chicken Skewers. A spoonful of toum elevates any steamed or roasted vegetable, or pasta or grains—or as a dipping sauce for good bread. I’ve even taken to slathering it on my homemade white pizzas before baking. Making toum requires a slow and steady hand to emulsify the garlic and oil in the food processor; consider toum like an aïoli with no egg. There are many methods cooks use to avoid a broken toum emulsion, such as adding an egg white, cooked potato, or cornstarch to the mix. I like my toum made without any of those, which can be replaced with patience—and a little ice water, which helps the emulsion hold.

5002873~"When­ we ­decided­ to start serving brunch, we were determined to stick with the original concept of the restaurant, ""tea turned on its ear,"" so we racked our brains to come up with a way to do french toast that was unique, fun, and, most important, tasty! We all tossed a bunch of ideas out there, and one of them was french toast bread pudding. All heads tilted curiously at this idea, so of course we tried it. The idea was for it to be like a true bread pudding—tea-infused, of course—but when the first batch came out, our chef said, ""I don't think this one is right—the top is crisp and chewy, but the bottom may be mushy."" We tried it, and lo and behold, there it was, the brunch item that would make eyes widen and taste buds explode: a layer of crisp and chewy french toast on top and a wonderfully gooey, creamy bread pudding infused with apricot brandy tea underneath. Note that you will need eight 2-inch-deep oven-safe glass bowls (8-ounce ramekins or crème brûlée dishes work well)."

5002889~The inspiration for test kitchen director Ruth Cousineaus velvety chilled bean soup comes from Mediterranean-cooking authority Claudia Roden's recipe for bissara, an Egyptian bean-and-herb purée. The beans here are lima and green, simmered in chicken broth (you can use vegetable broth if you want to go vegetarian) and then puréed until silky. The herbs—parsley, cilantro, dill, and mint—are blended with olive oil so that you can finish the soup with a verdant drizzle, but dont think of the herb oil as merely a garnish: Its bright flavor brings everything together.
5015589~Highly recommended!
5002891~Why you'll make it: Because it's the tastiest way we know to use up all those ripe tomatoes you've got at the ready. The flavors of cold soup become muted once the soup is thoroughly chilled. Before serving the gazpacho, check the salt and vinegar and then adjust them, if need be.

The tang of the feta compliments the sweetness of the salad and the bitterness of the endive leaf, and the jewel tones of the beet and persimmon make for a beautiful bite. Choose persimmons with the texture of a ripe tomato, as an under-ripe persimmon is too tannic to eat and will ruin the dish.

5002955~The Southwest’s favorite breakfast is often topped with a red sauce or salsa. This version has a tomatillo-based green (verde) sauce.
5002956~Highly recommended!
5002957~When not using this pesto to dress this very green salad, you could schmear it on just about any sandwich, or stir it into scrambled eggs.
5002958~Ribollita is a classic Tuscan soup that's made up of vegetable soup mixed with pieces of rustic bread. This version is packed with veggies—white beans, kale, chard, potatoes, tomatoes—and served with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
5006699~(Green Onion Mashed Potatoes)
5002960~Highly recommended!
5002961~This riff on traditional fried rice plays the sharp, spicy flavor of ginger off the sweetness of fresh pineapple to delicious effect.
5002962~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5002963~Remove the skin and fat from a whole cut-up chicken to make this Middle Eastern dish.
5002964~If your child is a truly adventurous eater, the Thai chile in the pineapple sauce won't faze her and will help sneak the fish in. If she balks at spiciness, on the other hand, replace the chile with a milder pepper, such as jalapeño, and remove the seeds and membranes. Or skip the hot stuff altogether—the sweetness and saltiness of the sauce will still be delicious.
5002965~Chiles Anchos Rellenos de Atún con Papas
5014312~Highly recommended!
5002967~This recipe was created to accompany Traditional Hamantaschen or Cream Cheese Hamantaschen .
5002968~Despite the fact that salmon seems to be everywhere these days, this dish is something very special. Mustard-herb butter gives a lemony pop to the meatiness of the fish, while French green lentils add a unique texture that regular brown lentils just don't have.
5002969~The bittersweet flavors in this quick dish pair well with roasted potatoes, creamy polenta, or cooked white beans.
5002970~Highly recommended!
5002971~A single pot-au-feu can become several courses. First, serve the marrowbones with salt and toast, then present the meats and vegetables. The broth can be a separate course or can be immediately ladled over the meats and vegetables, with mustard and horseradish added to taste and cornichons served on the side.

5002973~Highly recommended!
5014828~Daniel Boulud always had a preference for classic French desserts, so I developed this recipe for the lunch menu when I was pastry chef at Daniel. The dessert itself is very simple: We bake an undocked, thick round of puff pastry, letting it puff up high, and serve it hot, filled with Orange-Scented Pastry Cream and topped with a buttery caramel sauce and a few Candied Pecans. The puff pastry rounds should be baked à la minute, never ahead of time, though the dough can be rolled out and cut in advance, and stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to a day. Sometimes the best desserts are the simplest.
5010110~There is a historical reason why most Hanukkah menus offer foods that have been fried in oil. In the second century B.C., a one-day supply of oil inexplicably burned for eight days and eight nights after Judah Maccabee and his followers recaptured Jerusalem's Holy Temple from their Syrian oppressors. Hanukkah is the celebration of that miracle, and fried foods are served to commemorate the oil. In this country, the Eastern European potato latke is usually featured. These fritters are a Sephardic contribution to that tradition.
5002976~This elegant soup doesn't look or taste anything like leftovers.
5002977~Highly recommended!

5002981~The mango-pineapple chutney is a delicious condiment for these exotic potato cakes, which would be great with poached eggs for brunch.
5002982~Köfte are a street-food favorite in the Middle East. The warm, irresistible flavor of this version comes from a combination of allspice, cinnamon, clove, and Aleppo pepper, a Syrian chile with a mild kick.
5002983~Sophistication in a snap. Purchased puff pastry takes most of the work out of making this beautiful tart.
5002984~Serve the ham with baked sweet potatoes and buttered baby peas. Finish with wedges of sponge cake topped with fudge sauce.
5002985~Highly recommended!
5002986~Highly recommended!
5002987~The secret to a roast chicken with crispy skin and tender meat? Salting the chicken and letting it sit for at least a few hours. A little bit of beer really amps up the pan juices.
5002988~Highly recommended!
5002989~Highly recommended!
5002990~Clams and pork are a classic Portuguese combination. The briny sweetness of the bivalves and a tomato sauce studded with zesty chorizo bring out the richness of the chops.

Shelf Life: 1 week"
5002996~Bettina says that this recipe is one of her delicious and dependable standbys.

5003000~Los Angeles: land of sun, fun, and burritos. Southern California's Mexican-influenced cuisine has the potential to be an all-out fat fest (cheese, sour cream) or a healthy mix of carbs (tortillas, beans) and protein (chicken, beans). A chicken burrito with the full-fat works can tip the scales at nearly 600 calories and 31 fat grams. To slim it down, we stuffed it with all-white-meat chicken, less cheese and nonfat sour cream. We also rolled it in a whole-wheat tortilla for extra fiber.
5003001~Highly recommended!

5003011~A nice hors d'oeuvre teaming fresh vegetables with a simplified version of rouille, the spicy red pepper and garlic sauce that typically accompanies French fish soups.

5003017~An easy substitute for the mascarpone, a soft Italian cream cheese, is 12 ounces cream cheese blended with six tablespoons whipping cream and 1/4 cup sour cream.
5003018~Ninety-nine percent of cava—Spanish sparkling wine—is made in Catalonia. So it's natural that the bubbly beverage has found its way into many elegant Catalan desserts. Here it is combined with the luscious flavors and bright colors of strawberries and oranges in a refreshing sorbet.
5018487~The base for countless dishes in Japanese cooking. This method requires just 30 minutes to soak the kombu, unlike some that call for overnight soaking.

5003022~"""Five years ago, I threw my first dinner party,"" writes Kristin McGill of Chicago, Illinois. ""It was a memorable night with good friends, great food and lots of wine. That night, cooking became my passion. And despite all of the effort, I still love to throw parties. My husband, Henry, and I host get-togethers once or twice a month. I do most of the preparation — admittedly that's because I enjoy cooking so much that I prefer to have the kitchen to myself. But I have to confess that since I started sharing the counter space, I've discovered we make a great team."""
5003023~This vibrant condiment takes its inspiration from the popular cocktail the Cosmopolitan. The alcohol heightens the sauce's flavor, but for kids and nondrinkers, the recipe can easily be made nonalcoholic by substituting orange juice for the water and deleting the vodka and liqueur.
5003024~Sesame oil and rice vinegar spin the caprese eastward.
5003025~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003026~Highly recommended!

5003034~Highly recommended!
5003035~The sorbet can be processed in an ice cream maker or simply frozen in a shallow container (a 13x9-inch metal or glass baking pan works best).
5014249~This quick and easy rendition of the classic is made with canned chilies.
5003037~This fiery Sichuan classic is named for the pockmarked (po) wife (ma) who supposedly invented it at her husband's restaurant. I've made a version of it for years. At the culinary schools I attended in Chengdu recently, their technique of poaching the tofu, prior to stir-frying, to freshen and tenderize it was new to me, as was the wonderful effect of a lavish sprinkling of Sichuan-peppercorn powder.
5007418~Chicken cacciatore is a ubiquitous dish in Italian-American restaurants, but we think it is even more delicious when made with veal shoulder roast. Slowly braising the meat in a heady tomato sauce enriched with pancetta, olives, and porcini produces a dish so good, you'll find yourself sneaking nibbles all the way to the table. It's even better the next day—if you can contain yourself.
5003039~Serve with: Sesame breadsticks, and arugula tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.
5008004~Be sure to reserve two grilled chicken breasts and a cup of Mango-Sesame Dressing to use in the Asian Chicken-Noodle Salad .
5003041~Isn't brunch! Stick this strata in the oven as guests arrive.
5003042~This refreshing soup makes a great first course for a summer dinner party.
5003549~Edible wild mushrooms, are featured in a rich-tasting gravy for this delicious turkey. Because it is cooked slowly at a low temperature, the turkey is extremely moist and flavorful. Apply the spice rub one day ahead. Uncork a bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir.
5003044~This dish, from Golden Door executive chef Dean Rucker, only feels indulgent.
5003045~Highly recommended!

5003049~Highly recommended!
5003050~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003051~Chicken, eggplant, tomatoes, and red onion all get marinated in the same richly spiced coconut milk, then divided onto skewers by ingredient to ensure each is grilled to the optimal doneness—no overcooking the chicken because you're waiting for the onions to cook.
5003052~Highly recommended!
5003053~Gremolata is an Italian garnish traditionally made with finely chopped parsley, garlic, and lemon zest. Clementines add intriguing flavor, and the green gremolata looks beautiful against the white fish.
5004779~"Coconut, lemon rind, and raisins are a bright surprise. ""A lot of people buy my cookbook just to get this recipe,"" says Mrs. Wilkes."
5003055~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003056~Wrapped foods, such as the Vietnamese spring roll, the Filipino lumpia and the Chinese egg roll, have a long history in Asian cooking and are hot items right now all across America. The lime juice, ginger, cilantro, cucumber and mint in this recipe are found in the cuisines of all Southeast Asian countries. Round out this dinner with hot or iced jasmine tea and cold Thai beer.
5003057~These spicy snacks taste even better than nachos, plus the avocado and tuna add a hefty 10 grams of heart-healthy fat.
5003058~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003059~There are two ways to get tender squid: a very quick sauté or a very long simmer. This simple yet impressive recipe uses the former method. We call for a Thai or serrano chile because they're easier to find here — try your local supermarket — than the small, thin Italian hot chiles.
5003060~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003061~Be on the lookout for collards with smaller, tender leaves. If using more mature bunches, cut into thin ribbons instead of tearing.
5003062~A vanilla bean is an extravagance that lends a note of sophistication to this drink, but extract is a fine substitute.
5003063~Highly recommended!
5003064~Loaded with dried fruit, toasted almonds, and bittersweet chocolate, these blondies combine the best of a brownie with what you wish fruitcake could taste like. A terrific addition to any holiday cookie platter, they are also a satisfying stand-alone dessert.
5003065~Highly recommended!
5003066~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5003067~Highly recommended!
5009752~We tried making this oil with Sichuan peppercorns that were not ground but found eating them whole just too numbing. Like the red-chile oil above, it's the perfect thing for adding a final blitz of flavor.
5003069~Use prosciutto if Serrano is unavailable, and make sure the relish is nice and acidic to stand up to the richness of the ham and eggs. This recipe is from Morcilla, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.
5003070~In Austria this is called Krambambuli.

5003082~Sweet potatoes make this moist; cranberries and walnuts add texture and color.
5003083~Majorca, Spain
5003084~We've added an editor's note about broiling the chicken rather than grilling it.
5003085~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5004565~Use this fresh blend of spices and herbs to add pep to the Cajun-Spiced Turkey and Crawfish Gravy , or to season blackened redfish or gumbo.
5003088~Highly recommended!
5003089~The classic almond mixture known as frangipane fills an almond crust. Sweet plums and a brandied glaze top it off.
5003090~You've got a lot of cookies to make, so do yourself a favor and clear some freezer space. Many doughs can be made as far as a month ahead if wrapped properly. (That means airtight! In plastic!) Logs of slice-and-bakes—like these Chocolate–Pistachio Sablés—store best. And guess what? No need to defrost before slicing and zipping them into the oven.
5003091~Highly recommended!
5003092~If you can't find almond syrup, floral, almond-flavored orgeat syrup is a fine substitute.
5003093~For a light lunch, top the salad with grilled shrimp or tofu.

5003098~Highly recommended!
5003099~Serve with crusty bread and a salad, if you like.
5003100~This is one of the most popular seasoning mixes we sell, and it's a winner sprinkled simply over fish or used as part of a more complex recipe. This blend has just the right amount of garlic and onion, with paprika for depth and a bit of dill for flavor. But we think it's the celery seed that really makes this one sing. See what you think.
5003101~Highly recommended!
5003102~Sortilège is a blend of Canadian whiskey and maple syrup. Here it infuses the chestnuts with maple flavor and picks up the sweetness of the green beans.
5003103~"Anitra Earle of Yonkers, New York, writes: ""I'm a perfume detective who hunts down hard-to-find and discontinued scents. One of the benefits of running my business from home is that I get to cook every day. I usually make dishes that I've relied on for years."""

5003115~Highly recommended!
5003116~The unusual duo of honey and chocolate is a winner in this layer cake. It needs to set up overnight, so begin a day ahead.
5003117~Citrus segments get saucy in our play on duck à l’orange.
5003118~Highly recommended!
5003119~The duck marinates overnight in a spice rub, so start this recipe one day ahead.
5008571~"Sate Sapi<r>
Editor's note: This recipe is adapted from James Oseland's book Cradle of Flavor: Home Cooking from the Spice Islands of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. It was originally accompanied by Lemongrass-Shallot Sambal and was part of an article by Oseland on Indonesian cuisine."
5003121~"A popular cut in the West, tri-tip is also called ""triangle roast."" It comes from the bottom sirloin."
5003122~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5009230~Highly recommended!
5003124~This Vietnamese classic is usually made with top or bottom round beef, which is sliced and then marinated and grilled. We've adapted the recipe to use skirt or flank steak and made it easier by grilling the meat before slicing it.

5006376~Highly recommended!
5003131~(Ciliege al Vino Rosso)
5003132~Roasting the vegetables and adding red wine are the secrets to the satisfying flavor of this pot pie. Other root vegetables such as turnips or parsnips would work well here, too.
5003133~IMPROV: For a milder, creamier version, use a blend of Parmesan and Fontina instead of all Parm. (Semolina flour is sold at some supermarkets, Italian markets, and specialty foods stores.)
5005039~Highly recommended!
5003135~Tomato time is the best time to put this do-ahead soup on the menu.
5013635~Delicious with seafood and veggies.
5003137~Covered Apple Cake (Gedeckter Apfelkuchen) is one of the cakes you’re sure to find in almost every single bakery across Germany. To make it, you line a springform pan with a sweet short pastry, fill the crust with a chunky cooked apple filling studded with raisins and flavored with cinnamon and lemon, and then use the same crust dough to make a lid for the cake. I sometimes wonder if it isn’t the precursor to America’s apple pie, though in this cake, even after baking, the pastry remains soft and cakey thanks to the moist, cooked apple filling and a lemon glaze that is brushed on the top crust after baking.
5003138~Highly recommended!
5003139~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003140~Rightfully this cake belongs in the chapter with the other cakes that contain dried fruit, but to me it is the quintessential coffee cake. It is a quick and easy version of a cake that I remember from my childhood, made by the mother of my school friend, the late Noel Giles. Noel and I consumed about a ton of this cake per year between the ages of twelve and eighteen — a taste of it still makes me feel like a teenager.
5011738~Toasted walnuts add a rich nuttiness to earthy greens. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, use the reserved beet and Swiss chard greens and remaining chard stems from the Roasted Beet Salad with Flash-Pickled Radishes and Chard .
5003142~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003143~Using shrimp instead of chicken in this recipe makes for an equally delicious soup.
5003144~Highly recommended!
5017397~Like curry, za'atar is a spice blend that varies from cook to cook in the Middle East, its birthplace. My father was Assyrian, so I've always enjoyed the flavors of the region (though the closest I've yet traveled is Turkey). This is my interpretation, and it reflects my priorities: my favorite part of za'atar is the tart sumac, so it's particularly heavy in my version. And while some cooks grind their spices together, I like to leave the sesame seeds whole. You can find sumac in Middle Eastern groceries and from online sources such as Penzeys and Kalustyan's. For a perfect, quick snack, combine with olive oil and brush on pita.
5003146~These small turnips are perfect with duck or roast chicken.
5003147~Highly recommended!
5008088~This recipe originally accompanied Frozen White Chocolate and Hazelnut Dacquoise .
5013327~This dip is our version of a Catalan sauce that has many variations and tastes great with almost any type of grilled meat or fish. It's worth the extra trouble to use hazelnuts (which need peeling), as well as almonds. Even though 2 tablespoons of hazelnuts seems a small amount, they round out the flavor of the sauce.
5003150~Serve brisket with sauces, slaw, pickles, and rolls so guests can assemble into sandwiches.
5003151~Highly recommended!
5018889~Highly recommended!
5003153~This dish is a take on the bistro classic frisée salad with lardons. We recommend removing the ribs from the dandelion greens; though it's a rather lengthy process, the result will be much more delicate.
5003154~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003155~Highly recommended!
5013676~Potatoes are a must on any bistro menu. Here, they are grated and layered with cheese to form a large pancake-like galette.
5003157~Great with grilled chicken or meats, or as an addition to hamburgers and other sandwiches. If available, use Vidalia or Maui onions for this delicious condiment.
5006221~This hefty omelet is big enough for two people to share, and the recipe makes great use of the flavored goat cheese varieties now available at supermarkets across the country.
5003159~Highly recommended!
5003160~Highly recommended!
5003161~"Apricots and almonds have an affinity for each other, as you'll discover in this marriage of the stone fruit and a cool semifreddo dotted with crushed almond praline. This semifreddo (Italian for ""half-cold"") is like a softly set ice cream that doesn't require churning. Grappa lends the poached fruit character and depth."
5003162~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003163~Highly recommended!
5003164~Stir the mushrooms and leeks frequently enough so they caramelize without burning, then serve on top of steak.
5003165~The vitamin C used in this recipe prevents the apple juice from browning.
5003166~This recipe, a refined trail mix if you will, is based on mendiants, a traditional French Christmas dish that consists of almonds, figs, hazelnuts, and raisins.
5003167~"""Curry"" rhymes with ""hurry"" for a reason. A few shortcut ingredients yield a gently spiced, deep-flavored sauce that’s ready in under an hour."
5003168~Feel free to experiment with your favorite seafood in this classic San Franciscan fisherman's stew. And don't forget to use the toasts slathered with zippy gremolata butter to soak up the flavorful broth. Bonus: This stew is great for entertaining since you can make the base a day in advance.
5003169~Traditional potato latkes are spiced up with hot paprika and enhanced with earthy porcini mushrooms. They are especially good with roasted meats, poultry, or fish. This recipe will serve four to five as a side dish.
5003170~Highly recommended!
5003171~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003172~Highly recommended!
5003173~Porcini mushrooms smooth out the intense flavors of this traditional sauce of tomatoes, olives, anchovies and capers. Although puttanesca sauce is typically served with penne or spaghetti, fusilli holds the sauce better.

5003181~What to drink: Dry rosé wines from Spain (where they are called rosados) and France are great for warm-weather drinking and extremely food-friendly. Many New World rosés are made in a fruitier style, so check with a wine merchant before buying one of them. Serve all rosés chilled.
5005437~"Here's a special-occasion roast enhanced with classic Provençal seasonings. Roasting two large ends of tenderloin instead of one whole piece ensures even cooking. (The meat needs to be coated with its aromatic rub, then chilled for at least six hours before roasting.) Serve this elegant dish with <epi:recielink id=""2999"">Scalloped Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Herbes de Provence</epi:recielink> and a sauté of green beans, zucchini and red bell pepper. Uncork a sophisticated Rhône red such as Hermitage or Crozes-Hermitage."
5003183~Highly recommended!
5003184~A perfect accompaniment for cocktails. Most of the prep work here can be done ahead.
5007729~These brined green beans get their snappy flavor from fermentation. Use them to make the Dilly Bean Potato Salad, serve with charcuterie, or use as a Bloody Mary garnish.
5003186~The best blue cheese for this is salty but creamy, not too sharp or funky.
5003187~You don't have to cook the lasagna noodles first - just assemble the dish, cover and bake.
5003188~Using stale pita will keep the bread from getting soggy in the salad.
5003189~Highly recommended!

5003200~Ragoût de petits L égumes au Parmesan et Vinaigre Balsamique
5003711~The slight tang of this dessert is complemented by the sweet and sour flavor of the vibrant topping. Because the panna cotta can be made so far in advance, it's an ideal choice for a party.
5003202~This is a wonderful way to experience onions and it is reminiscent of the Alsatian specialty, flammekeuche. Combined with the cream, the onions (Rose de Roscoff, if you can find them) create a sweet, succulent foil for the bacon and the pizza dough. I like to serve this as a first course, with a lovely Gewurtztraminer.
5003203~A hearty sweet and savory stew that's a perfect seasonal meal when teamed up with crusty bread and a green salad.
5003204~Blanching the root vegetables shortens the stew's cooking time and keeps the flavors bright. Plus, the blanching water makes a great quick stock.
5003205~Buttermilk makes the cake tender, and cream cheese adds great texture to the frosting.
5003206~Active time: 45 min Start to finish: 1 1/2 hr
5003207~Pork and beef are the usual suspects when it comes to ribs, but the rich, bold flavor of lamb is a perfect match for this tangy Tex-Mex marmalade glaze. Grits cooked with a generous amount of Cheddar and Parmigiano-Reggiano round out the meal.

5003218~Fresh fennel bulbs and crushed fennel seeds add subtle anise flavor. Use a mortar and pestle to crush the fennel seeds, or simply place them in a plastic bag and pound them with a rolling pin. The soup can be made a day ahead and rewarmed before serving.
5003219~Highly recommended!
5003220~This salad-in-a-sandwich can also be made with individual sourdough rolls. There can be many variations on this theme, so use your imagination. You might replace the tuna with grilled leftover chicken or tuck in a bit of salami, mortadella or roast beef. The sandwich is best if made at least two hours before serving.
5003221~"When I worked in Gray Kunz's kitchens at Lespinasse, there was an honest-to-God Swiss princess living at the St. Regis Hotel. Her name was Princess Doria, and every night, she would phone down to the kitchen and tell us what she wanted to eat for dinner. In the beginning, Gray would cook for her himself: he was Swiss, she was Swiss, it was a whole Swiss thing going on. But after a while, he got tired of taking her calls, and the job devolved to me and the sous chefs. Every night, that phone would ring, and I would say, ""Good evening, Princess,"" and she would tell me what she wanted to eat that night. Princess Doria wasn't into super-fancy creative cooking: her thing was refined-but-homey. Some- times, for example, it would be a roast pintade for two: I would plate the breast for her, and the thighs for her cat. So I developed some dishes that were just for her. I named them after her: Salad Doria, Chicken Doria. And sometimes on cold winter nights, she would call down and say, ""Andrew, I would like some Soup Doria tonight, please."""
5003222~Pureed fresh mango gives this cheesecake a light and soft texture and subtle tropical fruit flavor.
5003223~Cumin, chili powder, garlic and fresh lime juice are combine in the easy-to-make spice paste. It adds lots of flavor to the beef in this recipe, but can also be used on chicken, pork, shrimp or firm fish like halibut, swordfish and shark.
5003224~A little soy sauce in the glaze ensures the burnished mahogany skin that holiday memories are made of. But it's not just for looks; this brined and buttered bird is seasoned inside and out.
5003225~Highly recommended!
5003226~Hit the reset button on your potato salad: These spuds are roasted, not boiled, and tossed with a mustardy vinaigrette and jalapeños while warm.
5003227~This is the dish that first got me into cooking. Talking about it got me my first job in a kitchen, and together with the help of friends, local restaurants, and family it’s the recipe we have worked on the most for this book, because we all know how good it should be. If I could only eat one thing in the world it would probably be my grandma’s jollof. She would regularly cook a big pot with care and patience and insist that everyone took home a small container of it. Cooking the rice and storing it for the following day or to give to friends to take away is part of a sharing culture that surrounds jollof—just remember to return the Tupperware!
5003228~A light, tender cake thats perfectly spiced. Any leftovers would be delicious with coffee or tea the next day.
5003229~We like these shrimp with corn on the cob, crusty bread, and a salad of summery greens. For dessert, offer a strawberry tart.
5003230~In this handheld treat, carrots, cucumbers, and smoked trout are tossed in a hot, sweet, and tangy sauce. For a simple side, steam some plain or sticky rice in the microwave, then chill it and mix in some chopped green onions, chopped fresh mint, lime juice, chili-garlic sauce, and a touch of soy sauce or fish sauce. For dessert, serve mango sorbet or fresh pineapple and mango slices.
5003231~Spice Cookies
5003232~Tarragon leaves and meaty morel caps shoot up all over the Jura mountains in the spring. Here, tossed with juicy green and white asparagus — Europeans are particularly mad for the latter — they're a genuine sampling of the season.
5003233~Highly recommended!
5003234~Traditionally, this flavorful sauté would be composed entirely of fresh cèpes (we know them better by their Italian name, porcini) gathered from the forests around Bordeaux. In this recipe, dried porcini mushrooms are supplemented with fresh large button mushrooms.
5003235~Also try this with scrambled eggs, omelets or a big bowl of chili.

5003238~Full-flavored and hearty, this classic pasta dish with bacon and tomato sauce is always a hit. Top it with plenty of grated Parmesan cheese.
5003239~The chicken is redolent of garlic, but not overly so; cooking the garlic cloves whole in their skins keeps the flavors in balance. What to drink: A spicy red from Spain's Ribera del Duero region. Try the 2000 vintage from this appellation, known for its rich blends of Tempranillo, Cabernet, and Merlot.

5003246~Kugels are baked puddings that come in many forms; Their base may be noodles, matzo, or bread or cake crumbs; most are sweet but some are savory; and they may be served warm or cold.

5003256~Although bisques tend to be thick and creamy, the following intensely flavorful version is light, with very little cream added.
5003257~This pudding is really best when made a year in advance and allowed to mellow. It was customary to make it early in Advent — the religious season before Christmas — and use it the following year. Everyone in the family was supposed to stir the pudding once for good luck. If you can't make it the year before, at least give it a few weeks to age.

5017787~This chicken makes a flavorful meal when combined with the Jasmine Rice and Carrot and Radish Salad . Steamed green beans and carrots would also make good sides.

5003271~Leaping off the backs of onion-soup-mix boxes and showing up at cocktail parties everywhere, Lipton’s sour cream-and-onion dip took the country by storm. Convenient and quick, the dip also tasted great on potato chips, without which, in the fifties anyway, it wasn’t a party. These days it isn’t a party without little toasts topped by something Mediterranean-hence this zesty update.

5003279~This recipe produces a deliciously moist fish with a subtly salty flavor.
5003280~This chili pleases all palates in my house—it's not too spicy or too mild, but it's loaded with flavor. I love the combination of black beans and chickpeas, but you can use any type of legumes you like. What really makes the chili, in my opinion, are the toppings! Some sharp cheddar, a dollop of cumin-cilantro sour cream, and diced red onions are a must. Sometimes I even add some crushed tortilla chips.
5003281~Here, eggplant stands in for the pasta.
5003282~Roasting the fish in salt makes it very moist — without, surprisingly, making it taste too salty. The lemony salsa verde adds zing and freshness that contrast nicely with the roasted fish.

5003297~Serve this take on the traditional Indian fresh cheese with olive oil, salt, and pepper for a simple yet impressive appetizer. The tofu-like texture also works well folded into soups or curries or pan fried and tossed into salads.
5003298~Highly recommended!
5003299~If most of the coconut sauces you've encountered have been heavy and cloying, this one — light and frothy, with delicate flavor — will be a delicious surprise. It would also be perfect for spicing up poached skinless boneless chicken.
5003300~Ouzo lends a subtle flavor to the melon. Pour more over before serving, if desired.

5003302~"Laura Trevino of Washington, D.C., writes: ""This hearty chowder is the perfect thing for a chilly evening. Serve it with dark beer and crusty bread or oyster crackers."""
5003303~An easy and fresh alternative to traditional green salads, this chilled North African-inspired dish combines potato, bell peppers, cucumbers, and olives with a light and tangy vinaigrette. Simple to prepare, it's great to double or triple for potlucks or group meals. Serve with the salad spread out on a large platter to let the colors and shapes of the ingredients shine. Make extra dressing to reinvigorate leftovers the next day. For a pretty variation, serve the salad garnished with sliced or diced cooked beets.
5015299~After sampling hundreds of brownies in the Gourmet magazine test kitchens, along with baking countless more at home (my first was from the cult classic Betty Crocker's Cook Book for Boys and Girls), I feel qualified to declare my pride in this brownie. It's old-fashioned in its use of unsweetened chocolate, yet the addition of cocoa takes it to the deeper, darker chocolate place we crave these days.
5003305~Broiled pineapple is teamed with an easy-to-make ice cream and topped with toasted coconut for a tropical treat. The pineapple would also be good with purchased mango or coconut sorbet or with vanilla ice cream.
5003306~Adding vinegar to the chorizo topping cuts the richness of the sausage and brightens the entire dish.
5003307~Something green and crisp is in order, and this simple salad is just the thing. A tangy from-scratch honey-mustard dressing will make salad eaters out of even the youngest at the table.

5003311~We tested this recipe with a variety of cornmeal brands, all of which worked fine. Do not substitute polenta, however; it made the soufflé much too heavy.
5003312~For a casual supper, broil rounds of prepared polenta roll, and toss romaine lettuce with oil and vinegar; end with cheesecake. For a special dinner, have broccoli spears with browned butter and orzo pilaf with Parmesan. Buy a hazelnut dacquoise or other fancy cake from the bakery for a great dessert.
5003313~We recommend using a sturdy food mill (available at cookware stores) to help produce a thick stew base from simmered vegetables and fish. Alternatively, you can use a large heavy-duty mesh sieve to strain the seafood broth. Then push through enough fish and vegetables to make 13 cups of stew base. Serve cioppino with sourdough toasts.

5003315~When the pumpkin pie is gone, but you've only just begun to get your fill of pumpkin desserts, this bundt will fill the void quite nicely (and the somewhat more assertive spices will welcome the season ahead). Best of all, the flavors continue to develop and the cake tastes even better a few days after it's baked, so it's perfect to have on hand at this time of year, when guests tend to drop in unexpectedly.
5003316~Fuji or McIntosh apples work best for this tart; other varieties may be too juicy.
5003317~Dried fruits and nuts are common in Moroccan pastries, but this tart is something special — the richness of the dough and the pop of the sesame seeds bring out that honeyed quality you normally associate with fresh figs. The cardamom cream is whisper-light, and the fresh orange segments are refreshingly cool.
5003318~"Sheila Jacobs and Lynn Kramer of Abreu, Cabrera, Dominican Republic write: ""We're both from the U.S., but we have lived in the Dominican Republic for about 25 years. We're friends, business partners, and neighbors, so we entertain together often. Cooking the local dishes has made us feel a part of the country."""

5003322~Easy to prepare and impressive to serve, this dish is perfect for an impromptu week-night dinner party.
5003323~Lean, smoked chicken breast gets a special — and healthy — treatment in this creative mix. The couscous absorbs the citrus juices (or use quinoa for extra protein — it has the highest amount of all the grains) for a tartness that plays well off the sweetness of the grapes. The bed of arugula is more than merely dish dressing: It's high in calcium and magnesium, making it a bone builder.
5006726~Rather than being crisp, these heirloom cookies are tender and cake-like.
5018458~Use one crust to make the pizza here. Chill the extra dough for up to four days or freeze for up to a month.
5003326~If you have a set of clay tiles or a baking stone, place it on the oven rack while preheating the oven. It will absorb the heat, and putting a pizza pan or baking sheet directly on top will ensure a crisp crust.

5003331~Sharp mustard adds edginess to the old standby combination of greens and bacon.
5003332~I'm not a big fan of microwaving, but in this case, it preserves both vegetables' deep color and nutrients as it speeds cooking. The honey and sweet sherry accents temper the bitter broccoli raab for a side dish that's fast, fresh, pretty.
5003333~To develop deep, satisfying flavor in this home-style stew, brown the beef slowly and thoroughly, and cook the onions until very soft and jammy.
5003334~"""Lidia's in Kansas City, Missouri, serves a rustic white bean and potato soup that would make a perfect meatless entrée for a winter evening,"" writes Deborah Johnson of Columbia, Missouri. ""I order it every time I go there. Do you think chef Dan Swinney would part with his recipe?"""
5003335~At Clark's Outpost Barbecue in Tioga, Texas, Warren Clark uses St. Louis-style pork ribs (slabs of ribs that have been trimmed to uniform size) and prepares them in a smoker.

5003362~A fine choice for a spring menu, although good whenever you can find fresh asparagus, this frittata has an especially nice flavor because the asparagus and leeks are roasted and caramelized before being added.

5003417~These crunchy cookies are a new version of classic Mandelbrot, which means almond bread in German. Here, recipe tester Selma Brown Morrow uses hazelnuts instead of the usual almonds. To add an elegant look, she dips the cookies into melted chocolate and seals them in holiday bags.
5015822~Like some sort of drug dealer, Joe (aka the big boss) has been known to keep a small plastic bag of this addictive Mexican spice rub in his glove box. And indeed, it's never a bad thing to have on hand. Although the recipe has a few steps to it, it's well worth the effort. At the restaurant, we use it to season everything from corn on the cob to chicken to our Spring booty taco. When cooking with it, just beware that it's quite salty. Also, it keeps for a long time, which means that you may want to make a double batch.

5003425~This jam has a good, concentrated flavor: The only liquid comes from the rhubarb and berries interacting with sugar and lemon juice. The quick-to-prepare jam also makes a nice filling for tarts.
5003426~This dish showcases salmon and the bright, fresh flavor of early-summer sugar snap peas in a dish that's perfect for a lunch with friends or a light dinner eaten outdoors. Broiling the delicate paillards seals in the juices and makes preparation a breeze.
5003427~Roasting the bones develops rich, long-cooked flavor and lends a dark golden color.
5003428~Highly recommended!
5003429~Highly recommended!
5003430~Toasting the curry powder with other aromatic ingredients before adding the liquid intensifies the flavor of this quick take on chana masala. You can roast the cauliflower and tomatoes a couple days ahead; cool, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
5003431~This cake has a crunchy pecan-brown sugar topping and a layer of pears in the middle.
5003432~Just in time for Thanksgiving, we’ve given the stunningly delicious Vegducken an autumnal makeover. This year’s entirely meatless take on turducken focuses on autumnal flavors with butternut squash, sweet potato, and parsnip filling in for the traditional meats. The mushroom-cranberry stuffing makes use of leftover vegetable scraps, making the dish #wasteless.
5005582~We liked this particular recipe with Lindt or Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate, which is around 50 percent cocoa solids. We tested the ganache with chocolate containing a higher percentage, and found the flavor too intense and the consistency less velvety.

5003435~Highly recommended!
5003983~For this recipe the lamb racks are frenched all the way down to the eye of the meat. For decorative purposes, we asked our butcher to leave a 1-inch-wide strip of fat along the top of the eye of the rack.

5003440~Potato chips are a great accompaniment. Finish with sliced bananas topped with brown sugar, cream and white rum.
5003441~These mushrooms and tomatoes make great side dishes and add zing to sandwiches, salads, and risottos. But we think they're best tossed with pasta and a little extra-virgin olive oil and chopped flat-leafed parsley or basil leaves.
5003442~"""Vegetable soup is something I can eat a ton of and still feel healthy. The problem is, I get hungry again two hours later. So I came up with a version with beans, which deliver protein and texture, tiding me over to the next meal."" —Rick Martinez, associate food editor, digital"

5003452~In Italy, the panna cotta (molded cooked-cream dessert) at each restaurant was different: Some included hazelnuts; some were made with eggs and some without. Taking a few liberties of our own - most notably adding sour cream - we created the following superb rendition.
5003453~The jalapeño-flavored butter is also good with chicken or fish, or even corn on the cob.
5003454~Highly recommended!
5010444~Cape Malays were the first to braise lobster in spices, which resulted in this delicious curry, for which many variations exist. Earlier writers specify tamarind juice; more recently this has been replaced by lemon juice. For a simpler recipe, use lobster tails instead of whole lobsters and omit the first step in the method.
5004480~This recipe originally accompanied Lobster Curry.
5016972~Geelrys (yellow rice) is great with bobotie and curry. Its other name, begrafnisrys (funeral rice) comes from the fact that it was always part of the meal served after funerals, a tradition of both the Dutch and the Cape Malays.

5003476~The relish is also a delicious complement to grilled lamb or chicken.
5003477~This delicious Portuguese regional specialty, called migas, is a dish of sautéed meats served over fried bread. Here is the version from Fialho restaurant in Evora, Portugal. They marinate the pork in a red-pepper paste popular in the Alentejo, but paprika makes a nice substitute. The seasoned pork needs to be chilled overnight, so begin this recipe a day before serving it.

5003479~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003480~This dish takes the best of traditional choucroute garni—smoked pork married to sauerkraut that's had its bite removed by being simmered in wine with bay and juniper—and lightens it up, pairing it with another Alsatian favorite, trout, and transforming a stick-to-the-ribs dish into something fit for a first course. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how the slight acidity of the kraut and the smokiness of the bacon play up, rather than dominate, the fish's clean flavor.

5003484~I love to celebrate birthdays with the crew and my bandmates. When we're on the road, it's nice to have the band family celebrate. Jimi's birthday falls at the end of October, and I sometimes make this silly chocolate cherry cola cake for him, decorating the top with chocolate cherry cordials or gummy candies. I always let him choose what he's got a hankering for, and it's often this.
5003485~The colored beets and bright green arugula in this dish make for a visually stunning presentation. The sweet roasted beets marinated in lemon vinaigrette play off the pure white fish and horseradish cream. Look for a few different types of beets, such as golden beets and Chioggia beets, and dress them separately, so the dark ones don't bleed their juices onto the lighter ones. In the spring, you could make this dish with wild salmon.

5013851~"When I started working at Payard Pâtisserie in New York City, I had already been a pastry chef in Boston for a few years. I couldn't wait to see what this French guy could teach me. On my first day, I was handed a stack of recipes—all in French—and immediately realized it would be a challenging year. I spoke and read basic French, but I was pretty hazy on much of the baking vocabulary, and there were many words I'd never even seen before. Pithivier was one of them. I didn't even know how to pronounce it. (It's pee-tee-vee-YAY .) ""Watch and learn,"" Chef Payard told me. He sandwiched a mound of rum-scented almond cream between two large squares of homemade puff pastry and then quickly scalloped the edges of the pastry to look like a sunflower. Slash-slash-slash went his paring knife over the top pastry as he etched sun rays into the surface. The whole thing went into the oven and emerged golden brown with a glorious starburst pattern on top. It put every other pastry I had ever made previously to shame."
5018446~In North Africa (and Marseille!) mint tea is generally drunk enormously sweet—the kind of sweetness that makes you a bit thirsty—which is exactly how I like it. Start with 1/4 cup of sugar and add more if you want it sweeter. To avoid any bitterness, do not let the tea boil once the mint has been added. For an earthy, Tunisian touch, dry roast a handful of pine nuts and drop them in the glass just before serving.
5003489~Highly recommended!
5003490~Highly recommended!
5003491~Risotto, by definition, is made with rice. But other grains—like the barley in this main-course recipe—can be prepared in the same style with equally terrific results. Toasting the barley enhances its nutty flavor and keeps it from getting soft and mushy.
5017183~Chef Ming Tsai created this recipe for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program. Serve the potstickers with his dim sum dipper and cranberry-teriyaki glaze.

5003500~It might look like a lot when the greens are raw, but add them all anyway. They'll quickly wilt down to a silky texture.
5003501~"It's funny how family sayings get picked up by friends. When I was around ten and my sister was about five, we were acting up at the dinner table. My daddy had worked a long hard day, and when he couldn't take another minute of our shenanigans, he pushed his chair back, folded his dinner napkin, and left the table. Totally unaffected by his frustration, my innocent little sister immediately piped up: ""Can I have Daddy's pork chop?"" I've often told friends that funny tale over the years. Now when I serve pork chops and someone wants seconds they'll chime in, ""Can I have Daddy's pork chop?"""
5003502~It’s crucial that this tart be frozen solid before slicing. If you are in and out of your freezer a lot, that may take longer than one day; err on the safe side!

5003524~We usually encounter only one version of Brazil's signature dish in this country — the one from Bahia, rich and almost currylike with coconut milk and dendê oil. This lighter one, from Espírito Santo, reflects that state's long coastline: Its bright broth results from the fish, tomatoes, lime juice, and vegetables, which meld beautifully. And it couldn't be easier. You simply layer the marinated seafood with the other ingredients in a cold pan and turn up the heat, simmering for just 20 minutes.
5003525~**What to drink:**A glass of bubbly would be perfect with the olives. Try Domaine Chandon Brut Classic (California, $20).
5003526~Broccoli would be just as good in this pasta recipe, as would diced winter squash such as butternut or acorn.

5003528~A Vietnamese-style salad that makes a refreshing accompaniment to any kind of barbecued meat.
5003529~We're certain that this soup will become a staple in your summer repertoire. It's simple to make, low in fat, and tastes like freshness itself.
5016633~If you've been looking for a chocolate sugar cookie that doesn't wimp out, delivering the dark chocolate hit you crave, this is the one for you. The thin coating of melted bittersweet chocolate, along with a festive sprinkle of crushed candy canes, only enhances the depth of flavor inherent in the cookie's deep brown color.
5003531~For perfectly browned tops, cook one pan at a time on the topmost oven rack.
5003532~I grew up in a household where we didn't eat meat on Friday, which presented a problem because when I was a child, I didn't like most fish or shellfish. My mother solved this dilemma by making me pasta with canned tuna and tomato sauce. This is my adult version of that recipe, made with high-quality preserved tuna with capers and anchovies added to hit the notes one expects in such a classic seafood pasta.
5003533~Fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff shared this recipe for one of her favorite salads—it's an updated take on a salad her Mom made when she was growing up in San Diego. We've included quantities for all the ingredients, but Minkoff encourages you to make this dish your own and to taste as you go.
5003534~This summer side cooks quickly, so the veggies retain their nutrients.
5005007~Canela, a Latin American cousin of cinnamon, is a leading player in this sauce. Once used by affluent Romans in love potions and perfumes, the spice, derived from the inner bark of a tropical evergreen, is hugely popular in New World cuisine, in everything from soups to desserts.
5003536~Brining these pork chops keeps them plump and juicy, but if lemon verbena for the brine isn't readily available, you can leave it out. Its subtle flavor probably won't be missed, especially if you serve the chops with the distinctly lemony hoppin' John risotto.
5018279~Although the origins of spritz cookies are fuzzy—some say they come from Scandinavia, while others cite Germany—I'm inclined to believe it's the latter, because spritzen means to squirt in German, which is how these cookies are formed: The dough is squirted from a cookie press. You can make any shape you want, but we love these old-fashioned washboard strips. If the idea of yet another piece of kitchen equipment deters you, rest assured these cookies are so delicious, you'll be baking them more than once a year. A cookie press is not expensive and with all the different shapes you can make from the dough, it will more than pay for itself in fun and entertainment over the years for the child in all of us.
5003538~"Robert Colombi of Paris, France, writes: ""My mother was Sicilian and my father, Corsican, but I was born in Morocco and lived there for many years. I learned how to cook mostly from my mother, but also from my many travels throughout Morocco (which is why my favorite spices are coriander, thyme, and cumin). As I became older, I developed a stronger interest in cooking, especially after I moved to France and got married. I guess I started to feel very nostalgic about the country of my childhood, and it became more important for me to remember and re-create those tastes for my French friends and family."""

5003544~The best way to eat sugar snap peas is right off the vine. This recipe ranks a close second, though. I pickle any sugar snap peas that the kids don't eat right away, and continue to enjoy them for weeks after the pea vines have wilted away.

For dinner, serve in small portions and follow with grilled ribs, grilled salmon, or just about anything grilled.
5003548~Save time by using vacuum-sealed pouches of tuna, which don't need to be drained.
5003549~Edible wild mushrooms, are featured in a rich-tasting gravy for this delicious turkey. Because it is cooked slowly at a low temperature, the turkey is extremely moist and flavorful. Apply the spice rub one day ahead. Uncork a bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir.

5003554~Here's an updated version of the ice cream pie — a dessert popular in America for years. It has a parfait filling instead of ice cream and is assembled in a springform pan.

5003556~We think bowls made of ice are the perfect vessel for this soup, but if space is tight in your freezer, regular soup bowls will work just fine.

5003595~Pico de gallo, also known as salsa Mexicana, has become a common sight on tables in the U.S. and it's easy to see why. The mixture of raw, chopped ingredients improves just about any meal with its lively acidity, lip-tingling heat, and crisp texture. This version is a riff on the classic that swaps lemon for lime to great effect. Whenever I take a bite I have a heretical thought: This is so delicious that maybe we Mexicans should use only lemons!

5003601~Broccoli-cheese soup is my life. There’s something about it that triggers a happy, peaceful memory. I just don’t know what the memory is. So I guess technically, it isn’t really a memory at all. I think a memory, by definition, is something that someone actually has to remember.

5003616~Here, handsome and crowd-pleasing beef tenderloin is first rubbed with an Indian-inspired combination of spices—cardamom, mustard, and others work in concert with the nuanced heat of black peppercorns—and then seared to form a fragrant, inviting crust. Finishing it in a moderate oven results in a roast that is evenly rosy, juicy, and as delicious as it is beautiful. Like the bulgur with herbs and the bevy of beans and basil , it can be served at room temperature.

5003623~The only thing better than Sloppy Joes for dinner is taco night. This hybrid is the best of both worlds.
5003624~A rack of lamb, being a red meat, is roasted to a lower internal temperature than chicken, veal, or pork, meaning that it releases little in the way of juices during the roasting process. To supplement the jus, spread the roasting pan with the trimmings from the rack (with the fat trimmed off) or a pound or so of lamb stew meat cut into small pieces and brown these in a hot oven before setting the rack on top. The flavor of the jus can also be accentuated by caramelizing the juices once or more after deglazing as described above for the saddle of lamb.

5018223~You can select any type of bottle you like for this citrus-scented spirit, but choosing a wide-neck one makes it a snap to place the citrus peel into the vodka. For easy gift wrapping, tie ribbons around the neck to match the colors of the peels. Tell the recipient to use the vodka in orange juice or lemonade, or shaken or stirred in a Martini, or to serve it ice-cold and straight up.

5003631~The delicious breadcrumb crust was probably created when white flour wasn't readily available in Friuli.
5018740~Highly recommended!
5003633~Crumb toppings normally appear on fruit desserts, but a savory mixture of grated pecorino and toasted walnuts works in much the same way, adding textural contrast to delicate fettuccine and grilled zucchini. Garlic-chile oil jazzes up the flavor.
5004778~To prepare these without an ice cream maker, pour the sherbet base directly into pop molds. If you don't want to use the molds and you have churned the mixture in an ice cream maker, the sherbet can be transferred to a resealable container, then simply scooped into bowls. Begin making this dessert one day ahead.
5003635~Anyone who's ever dropped into a local bakery for a morning snack can testify to the appeal of coffee and a doughnut. Here, yeast doughnuts with a touch of cinnamon get an extra jolt of flavor from a sweet espresso glaze.
5003636~Macarrones con Crema y Queso
5003637~Highly recommended!
5003638~For tender burgers, gently combine and shape the chicken mixture.
5003639~Pork may be overcooked a little, but don't overcook the vegetables. They should retain good color and texture.
5003640~"New Englanders find the very idea of tomatoes in clam chowder to be abhorrent; of course, by referring to the aberration as ""Manhattan clam chowder"" they're overlooking the fact that their own Rhode Islanders also add tomatoes to clam chowder. And let's not forget about the hundreds of ethnic cuisines around the world that combine tomatoes with shellfish in soups and stews. Unlike the New England purists, we just don't find an intrinsic problem with clams and tomatoes. We do find, however, that most Manhattan clam chowder served in restaurants is positively awful: thin, unclammy, often tasting like vegetable soup out of a can with a few canned clams thrown in. Try the following recipe, and you'll see how good this soup can be."
5003641~These flavorful marinated onions also make a great condiment for grilled steak.
5003642~Highly recommended!
5003643~(Egg, Pickle, and Caper Mayonnaise)
5004502~"This recipe is an accompaniment for <edit:recipelink id=""230642"">Sausage-Wrapped Lamb Chops</edit:recipelink>."
5003645~Fast-rising yeast makes this bread a snap to prepare. A dry red wine, like Chianti, is ideal with this Italian-accented menu.
5011639~This version of colcannon, usually a combination of buttery mashed potatoes and cabbage, is a wonderful accompaniment to grilled sausages or Beef Stew with Stout .
5003647~Highly recommended!
5019207~Celery leaves (which are left over from the celery used in the soup) are great in the dumplings.
5003649~Be sure to start soaking rice 4 hours before preparing stuffing.
5008065~Highly recommended!
5010685~This quick-and-easy garnish would also make a great cocktail snack.

5003654~This recipe is an accompaniment for Meringue-Topped Raspberry and Peach Ice Cream Cake .
5003655~Highly recommended!
5003656~Complement the delicious soup with biscuits and a spinach and red bell pepper salad. Top it all off with some sliced sweetened plums spooned over vanilla ice cream.
5003657~My friend Keena lives less than a mile away and has a plum tree she can't keep up with. In early fall, she makes jam with as many plums as she can and sends me home with a big grocery bag full of them every time I see her. I'm not much of a canner, so I began sautéing them and using them as a topping for yogurt and porridge, and as a filling for these simple buckwheat crepes. While buckwheat groats have a pretty distinct flavor and can be a hard sell for many folks, buckwheat flour is commonly used and adored in both sweet and savory crepes. For this recipe, use oval-shaped Italian plums (or prune plums) if you can; they're nice and firm and lend themselves well to sautéing—or just plain snacking.
5003658~Highly recommended!
5003659~Highly recommended!
5018247~I use simple syrup for keeping cake layers extra moist. Plain simple syrup works perfectly well on its own, but when I have used vanilla bean pods on hand, I like to steep them into the syrup (feel free to keep them stored in the syrup indefinitely). It's an unnecessary step, for sure, but I always welcome a little extra pop of vanilla flavor in my cakes.
5003661~The hot toddy is not simply a mixture of hot water and booze. It's a miracle worker, a doctor, and a life coach in a cup. And although it does seem to do the trick for everything from a sore throat to a cough, it's just as good when you're healthy. This version—from Damon Boelte, bar manager at Prime Meats restaurant in Brooklyn—omits the usual honey or sugar and plays up the herbal and spicy notes instead.
5003662~Butternut is one of my favorite squashes. We often bake a small butternut squash (about 1 pound) at home; we split it lengthwise, seed it, score the flesh with a knife, sprinkle on a little salt, and bake, skin side down, for 1 hour in a 400-degree oven. Excellent in soup and pureed, butternut squash is always welcome at our table. This gratin is quite rich and should be reserved for special occasions, like Thanksgiving.
5003663~Serve a salad and some wine alongside, and you're ready for company.
5003664~Remember, you absolutely cannot make delicious fried rice using freshly cooked rice! If you cook the rice yourself (a day to a week ahead), buy long-grain (Carolina) rice and follow the package directions for making drier rice.
5003665~A steak sauce good enough to rival the most popular brand makes this steak (or any, really) even more delicious.

5015589~What a fantastic barbecue side: It's juicy, crunchy, and bright enough to provide delicious relief even from your richest dishes, and substantial enough to stand in for starchy sides like potatoes. I add a ton of marjoram and dill, but chives and basil taste amazing, too.
5003679~Roasting the turkey under foil for the first 1 1/2 hours infuses lots of moisture and flavor into the bird.
5003680~Highly recommended!
5003681~Using meat loaf mix — a combination of ground beef, veal, and pork — ensures a juicy result. While the meat loaf cooks, mash some potatoes and boil some green beans. Warm apple pie from the bakery is a perfect finale.

5003684~"Pumpkin pies have long been favored in New England; there is a recipe for a ""pompkin"" pie in Amelia Simmons's 1796 American Cookery. New England colonists, in spite of their puritanical reputation, were known to enjoy a tot of rum now and then. And if the liquor was hidden in a pie, even the ladies were able to indulge."
5003685~"""On a recent trip to the Napa Valley, my husband and I had lunch with friends in the Cask Room at Merryvale Vineyards in St. Helena,"" writes Karen G. Shughart of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. ""The meal was prepared by Knickerbocker's Catering. Desserts must be their specialty, because the apricot tart with cornmeal crust was fabulous."""

5004095~This recipe is an accompaniment for Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Peach Barbecue sauce .
5003701~Italian fruitcakes with Frangelico chocolate sauce If you don't have the mini Bundt molds called for, oversize muffin cups (about one-cup capacity) can be used instead. Begin preparing this at least a week ahead.
5003702~Highly recommended!
5003703~This recipe isn't easy, but if you're looking for the wow factor, here it is. Coming at the end of the meal, the dish reprises the flavor of the stuffed dates because each bite packs enormous punch as the sweet, savory, and acidic flavors come rushing forward.
5003704~Roasted pork loin, which is commonly served on special occasions in Denmark, is here richly flavored with cardamom, juniper berries and currant jelly. Ask the butcher to cut into the chine bone of the rib roast to make it easier to carve. Note that the pork needs to marinate at least 12 hours before roasting, so plan accordingly. Uncork a fruity Merlot to go with it.
5003705~Think of Bo Ssäm as Korean lettuce tacos. Invite the gang to make their own lettuce rolls with the fall-apart tender pork, rice, pickles, and a raw oyster (optional, but we really recommend it).
5003706~Highly recommended!
5003707~Highly recommended!
5003708~"The act of deglazing—using a liquid to ""release"" pan drippings—is the tried-and-true trick to getting a quick, flavorful sauce. The soy in this recipe melds wonderfully with the wine and adds a certain depth."
5003709~If fresh chervil is unavailable in your area, substitute fresh basil leaves for the oil and garnish the mussels with tiny basil leaves.
5003710~We sympathize with the purists when it comes to tuna salad sandwiches: the combo of canned tuna, just a little mayo, and just good white bread is an eternal verity. But we have developed this fancier variation that is also delicious. It preserves the tuna flavor, it's not too rich, it's loaded with crunchy vegetables, and it flies out of the store every day.
5003711~The slight tang of this dessert is complemented by the sweet and sour flavor of the vibrant topping. Because the panna cotta can be made so far in advance, it's an ideal choice for a party.
5003712~Highly recommended!
5003713~Be sure to use regular peanut butter — not old-fashioned or freshly ground — for the best consistency in the cookie batter and the filling.

5003718~In this confit, called tfaya, all the ingredients blend together, taking on a melting softness as well as the distinct notes of honey. Added to savory dishes like the couscous or even the lamb, it provides an unexpected brightness along with the sweetness.
5003719~To prepare the brussels sprouts before cutting them, be sure to pull off the tough outer leaves. Thin slicing and simple seasonings will convert those who aren't fans of brussels sprouts. Petrale sole, a Pacific Coast fish, is prized for its delicate flavor and thick fillets.
5003720~What's for dinner? A big ol' heap of Louisiana, in the form of potatoes, corn, and shrimp. It's all here, it couldn't be easier, and dipping everything in the spicy sauce while you sip a cold beer is pretty much the perfect thing to do on a steamy summer evening.
5003721~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003722~Highly recommended!
5003723~The chocolate topping on this striking rectangular tart is very rich, so a small serving of the dessert goes a long way.
5015548~There's lots of bold flavor in this hearty stuffing, which, though inspired by a classic Italian combination, happens to work in perfect concert with everything on the American holiday table. Baking it in a wide dish yields plenty of crusty top for everyone.
5003725~Highly recommended!
5003726~This recipe calls for aged Sherry (instead of vinegar), which gives the dressing an added kick.
5003727~Vegan
5003728~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5003729~Ever dream about bringing an impressive roast to the holiday table with equally impressive ease? Now you can. Stuffing and preparing the pork a day ahead leaves you free to entertain and makes the meat especially flavorful as well. Bacon wrapped around the roast keeps it moist as it cooks. Prunes and dried apricots simmered in Port bring a fruity but not overly sweet intensity to the pork and its sauce.

5006624~I love Jim Lahey's crust because it's thin, crispy, and so very reliable. I can't ever remember a night where it didn't work. When we're feeling healthy, we replace the white flour with whole wheat flour-if you want to be sneaky about it with the kids, you can start by just replacing half with whole wheat flour. We usually use one ball of dough for one dinner and then freeze the extra for another dinner later. To thaw, remove from freezer about two to three hours before using and work it with your hands if it's still stiff.
5003738~Highly recommended!

5010781~"""I grew up in the middle of Croatia, near Zagreb, where the cuisine is very heavy — lots of meat and potatoes,"" writes Snjezana Hercigonja of Raleigh, North Carolina. ""But when I was young, it was customary to vacation on the Mediterranean coast in the summer, where you go to the market every day to see what's good, and everything is really fresh and light. Even the fat is good, since it's usually olive oil. This recipe is based on dishes from that region."""

5003762~"""Koreans are short rib masters,"" says Chou, who lived and cooked in Korea for several years. ""It's their favorite cut."" While some ribs are sliced thin, marinated, and grilled, others are reserved for stews and soups. Kalbi jjim, one of the countrys best-known concoctions, shares some ingredients with a European beef stewnamely, carrots, onions, and potatoes—but here the brothy, slightly sweet dish gets its robust undertones from dried mushrooms, soy sauce, fish sauce, and molasses, plus a dollop of hot red-pepper paste. Though it is rustic-looking, the meat's tenderness and the broths amazing depth make clear why this dish is a national treasure."

5003769~"The lamb top roast is one of the three ""subprimal"" cuts that can be cut from the leg of lamb. The equivalent of the beef top round roast, but smaller and more tender, it provides a succulent boneless lamb roast when you don't want to deal with a whole leg."
5003770~A mixture of prosciutto, rosemary and plenty of garlic rubbed under the skin of the turkey gives it a distinctively delicious taste. True garlic lovers can squeeze some of the pan-roasted garlic into the gravy for even more flavor. Begin the meal with an appetizer of chilled shrimp with lemon and dill, and offer a radicchio salad as a first course. Pour a Chianti Classico Riserva.

5003785~If you were a sporty type at school, you may remember those little orange slices that were given out at half time during matches. A momentary respite from jumping and leaping in the air on a cold windy netball court in the depths of winter seems to be a vivid memory from my early teenage years. Naturally, giving you a recipe for orange slices may have proven uninspiring so, with a bit of cooking magic, I would like to introduce you to my watermelon Jell-O shots… A happy walk down memory lane with a very modern twist. For an alcoholic version, replace 1/2 cup of the water with some vodka.
5003786~With these distinctly Middle Eastern kebabs, the minty coolness of the yogurt sauce offsets the allspice, pepper, and cinnamon in some of the most succulent and juicy meatballs you have ever tasted.
5003787~This variation on paella uses Israeli couscous in place of rice.
5003788~In this version of the classic Parisian gâteau, layers of soft coconut meringue alternate with a dark chocolate and rum ganache filling. Do-aheads: ganache, 2 days; meringue, 1 day; marjolaine, 1 day.
5003789~Try this refreshing dessert with other firm, ripe fruit, including pineapple, peaches, or plums. Chill any leftover syrup for sweetening iced tea or cocktails.
5003790~If anchovies rolled around capers aren't available, substitute a two-ounce can of anchovies plus one teaspoon of capers. serve with: Potato pancakes, chunky applesauce, and red-cabbage slaw.
5003791~Begin making the lime-ginger curd one day before baking the cake. The assembled dessert can be chilled overnight before serving.
5003792~You'll notice that there's no wine or other braising liquid called for here. The veal cooks in the succulent juices exuded by the tomatoes and onions.
5003793~Highly recommended!
5003794~This recipe originally accompanied Baja Fish Tacos .
5003795~This version of blini—a tribute to the Russian communities throughout the New York metropolitan area—is fast because it does not require yeast. If buckwheat flour is unavailable, whole-wheat flour makes a good substitute.

5003802~This dish has been one of my family's favorites for years; the secret to its enduring popularity is the caramelized onions. I cook them long and slow until they are meltingly tender and deep golden brown. Their rich sweetness rounds out the earthy flavor of the lentils and kale.
5003803~Highly recommended!

5006955~The bright flavors of fresh parsley and garlic make this vibrant sauce sauce a favorite accompaniment to Argentine beef. It packs a punch, so start with just a drizzle.
5011384~Grilling husked corn on the cob produces nicely browned and sweetly caramelized kernels that are absolutely addictive. The garlic butter is a terrific finishing touch.
5003807~Named for the four fruits that go into this recipe, the drink is a refreshing accompaniment to brunch at Sarabeth's restaurant in New York.
5003845~Tarragon and mustard may be a classic French combination, but this menu is all American. A domestic Chardonnay, light beer, or fresh lemonade are perfect partners.
5003809~Highly recommended!
5003810~Cardamom loses flavor and aroma quickly, so be sure to store it in an airtight container in a cool dry place — never near your stove.
5003811~Avocado shells make handy vessels for a bright salad made with the scooped-out flesh. Lime juice, garlic, and a pinch of cayenne flavor the dressing. The salad can also be served as a topping for quesadillas or as a fresh filling for tacos.
5003812~Tenderloin roasts vary in shape, size, and weight. For this recipe it's important that the tenderloin be of uniform shape and size. If you can't find a whole tenderloin, 2 center-cut pieces will work. (cut a whole one in half in order to brown it on top of the stove.)
5003813~This pretty and refreshing soup - flavored with curry, cumin, ginger and garlic-is quick to prepare: Just put everything in the blender and puree it.
5004522~Serve with red wine sauce .
5003815~If venison isn't for you, beef tenderloin is a good alternative (see cooks' note, below). Because beef is not as dense and rich as venison, the portions are slightly larger (cooking times and temperatures will also be different).
5003816~We love using kohlrabi in salads. The light green or purple veggie looks like a cross between a turnip and a fennel bulb and tastes like celery root or a mild turnip.
5003817~Highly recommended!
5003818~The recipe below is part of a healthy and delicious spa menu developed exclusively for Epicurious by Ananda spa in India. The low-fat, low-calorie, and vegan broth is loaded with disease-fighting herbs and spices, including ginger, which has anti-inflammatory properties and is a digestive aid, cinnamon, which has been shown to help balance blood sugar, and garlic, which has powerful antimicrobial properties. If you are following an Ayurvedic diet, the experts at Ananda recommend this for vata and kapha doshas.

5003821~This breakfast treat tastes decadent but is really quite low in fat. It's topped with maple-spiked yogurt.
5003822~This tart was inspired by a plum tart often cooked by the mother of Lisa's college roommate. Due to Lisa's reckless dissemination of that recipe (which caused an overpopulation of plum tarts up and down the eastern seaboard), her recipe-exchange privileges with said mother have been revoked.
5003823~Don't save shortcakes just for strawberry season. They're also delicious served with other fruits, like this tropical combination.
5003824~This is one of my pantry staples; you'll find it in many of the recipes throughout this book. It makes for a super-easy sauce on its own, or you can mix it with lemon juice or vinegar to create a great dressing in less than a minute. Whenever almonds are on sale at the local store, I grab a few bags and make big batches, freezing some for future use. Each time you use this oil, make sure to grab an even proportion of oil to almonds so that you don't end up with a lopsided ratio.
5010388~Highly recommended!
5003826~Eating one of these individual pies is quite different from your basic fork-and-plate experience. A bite through the crisp pastry, sparkling with sugar, reveals a thick filling of sweet-and-tart fruit.
5003827~This may not be as good as a true foie gras, but it's similar enough in flavor for a dish that costs only pennies to make. Not only can the pâté be served on toast — it can also serve as a finish for a classic Beef Wellington or enhance a stuffing or a meat loaf.

5003837~The keys to this fast, simple dish, which was inspired by a crab-stuffed tomato at Yves Camdeborde's Paris brasserie, Le Comptoir du Relais, are ripe tomatoes, fresh herbs, and excellent crabmeat.
5018340~This is our basic vinaigrette, three parts oil, one part acid, pared almost to its essentials—no shallots, no salt and pepper—so that it can be used almost like a sauce base. The mustard adds flavor and strengthens the emulsion. Any number of additional ingredients may be added to it, depending on how it's to be used. Most often it's used to dress greens that have been seasoned with salt and tossed with fresh herbs, as with the Bibb Lettuce Salad .
5003839~Spinaci all'Ebraica
5003840~In Trinidad, this rustic coconut loaf with a biscuit-like texture is traditionally eaten with bul jol, which is also known as pick-up saltfish . The bread is quick and easy to make, and is great for breakfast with tropical jams such as guava, passion fruit, or mango.
5003981~This recipe could easily become a year-round favorite—simply substitute supermarket rotisserie chicken for the turkey. And as a special treat for the kids (or the kid in you), make individual-size pies, using eight 10- to 12-ounce gratin dishes.
5003842~Highly recommended!
5003843~Link likes to use herbs from his garden in this recipe.
5003844~The combination of seafood, sausage, and grits creates a hearty and homey dish that brings the smells and tastes of the Lowcountry into your kitchen, no matter where you live.
5003845~Tarragon and mustard may be a classic French combination, but this menu is all American. A domestic Chardonnay, light beer, or fresh lemonade are perfect partners.
5003846~We've made this colorful dish using fresh cooked rice instead of leftover takeout. There's plenty here for a hearty breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
5003847~Tarator is usually made with tahini, but the base for this recipe is almonds. It serves as both a binder for the rice cakes and as a sauce.
5018177~Highly recommended!
5003849~This pan-Asian tofu gets brilliant color and lively flavor from an easy cilantro pesto. To make this dish vegetarian, you can simply replace the fish sauce with soy sauce.
5003850~Both ginger plants and tamarind trees grow in tropical spots around the world, including India, Asia, and Latin America, where the two seasonings are regularly used in marinades, sauces, and drinks. So it was only natural for Feniger to take some of the spicy ginger syrup she had developed for the Canton Ginger Kick and mix it with tart tamarind. The result is very fresh and very quaffable. Feniger says that when they make it at Street, they often save the tamarind pulp that's left in the sieve and add more water; that tamarind liquid will be thinner than the first batch, but it will still have enough of its signature fruity sharpness for another round.
5003851~A mug of hot chocolate or a glass of milk would complement these updated, sophisticated chocolate chip cookies.
5003852~Like most foods they can pick up and dip, this gentle introduction to sushi, which takes only 30 minutes to prepare, is a hit with kids. Serve with low-sodium soy sauce (or whatever dip will get your child excited about eating).
5003853~Whatever else you set out, great smoked salmon will always draw a crowd. And like any good leading actor, it works well with all of the supporting players, from horseradish cream to egg salad.
5008617~Frying avocadoes may seem as strange to you as they did to me until I tasted them at Puntarena in Mexico City. They are a delight, so give them a try!
5003855~A pinch of cayenne and two kinds of mustard give this sweet and savory condiment a kick.
5003856~Curry crust? Trust us: This lightly spiced crumb will win Best in Show. If you want to take it even further, add a teaspoon of toasted crushed cumin seeds, too.
5003857~In this unusual side dish from Spring restaurant, often under appreciated parsley gets the creamed-spinach treatment—and a little help from aromatic orange zest, mint, and fresh ginger.

5003861~Almonds were brought to Spain by the Moors, and they've featured in Andalusian cuisine ever since. Typically they are used as a thickener for sauces and, most famously, as the base of ajo blanco. Whole Marcona almonds are roasted with sweet or hot smoked paprika–I prefer to use sweet paprika, introduce a little heat via cayenne, and round it out with cumin and salt. In the event of a crippling Marcona almond shortage, regular blanched almonds will do the trick.

5003869~This gratin, which is delicious with roast chicken or pork chops, employs a favorite technique: cooking vegetables covered with a round of parchment paper placed directly on them, rather than with a lid. This low-tech method allows just enough steam to escape while keeping the vegetables—leeks, in this case—perfectly moist. A bit of lemon zest helps balance the gratin's richness.

5016179~Improv: Try mussels instead of clams; substitute basil for the parsley.
5003876~If you can't find kumquats, don't panic — the recipe works fine without them.
5007643~This pie crust is light, flaky tender and very crisp. It has a glorious butter flavor and is an ideal container for any pie or tart recipe. I strongly recommend commercial or homemade pastry flour, as it will result in a more tender crust than one made with all-purpose flour.
5005074~Salsa Mexicana

5003882~Maple syrup brings sweetness and warm color to the pork. Wild rice pilaf, brussels sprouts and a Gewürztraminer would be nice accompaniments.

5003884~The humble potato, given a little something extra, always elicits oohs and aahs. This is especially true when it's tossed with an herb-infused oil and cooked on the grill.
5003885~This classic combination of melted cheese and toasted bread is also called Welsh rarebit — an attempt to dignify the original (and slightly silly) name. For best visual appeal, use an aged yellow Cheddar for the sauce.
5003886~For a salty, savory, crunchy boost, sprinkle this on roasted vegetables, soups, and hot cereal.

5013814~Served with small scoops of ice cream and a pink-hued syrup, this fruit-filled dessert delivers a glorious finale to a special dinner. Strudel dough looks more difficult to make than it really is. The secret is using bread flour, a high-gluten flour, which allows you to stretch a small amount of dough over a large surface.
5012673~Wonderfully festive and fun, these candied star-shaped chips — a favorite among children — have a slight tropical flavor that makes them a sunny treat with or without the strudel.
5003905~In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).
5003906~This dish is sumptuous but a snap to make. Once you've browned the chicken, simply pop it into the oven and baste it occasionally. Serve it over buttered noodles to soak up all the luscious juices.

5003925~Budino is what Italians ask for when they want pudding. Sub in any stone fruit for the plums.
5005756~Here's a good base recipe for using frozen berries to prepare a flavorful sauce. I find that frozen berries need to cook a little to make them less watery and to concentrate their flavor. Look for raspberries that come frozen in a bag. Feel the bag to make sure all of the individual berries are loose and not clumped together. Bags of frozen berries tend to taste better than those frozen in a block.

5003935~"Mom's Russian ""Hamburgers"""
5003936~"At the end of the century, vegetarian cooking gained wide acceptance-and became sophisticated. Wraps (basically burritos) were a hot fast food; everything from Thai chicken to ahi tuna got ""wrapped"" in flour tortillas or flatbread. The two trends pair up in this terrific dish. To make these even more like burritos, add one 15- to 16-ounce can of drained black beans to the filling."
5003937~A flavorful tomato sauce that’s a cinch to make and rock shrimp that come already peeled mean a weeknight dinner recipe has never been so easy—or delicious.
5019416~Like the best dressings, this is good on so much more than greens: Drizzle it on roasted sweet potatoes, brush it onto broiled eggplant, or toss it with cold soba or udon noodles. Use it to marinate mushrooms before grilling them to make Juicy Bella . Look for miso paste in the refrigerated section of natural food stores and Asian markets. If you can find South River brand, made in Massachusetts, snap it up; it's the best I've tasted outside Japan.

5003950~"Trust us, this combination is super-clean and green, refreshing and yummy. The alkalinizing fresh pineapple pairs beautifully with the spice of the arugula/rocket. And macadamia nuts are a high-energy food that adds a crunchy rich texture and a healthy dose of protein and fiber (we don't mind at all if they do not fully incorporate) as well as monounsaturated fatty acids—or ""good"" fat—that significantly reduce blood serum cholesterol levels. Think of this smoothie as a cleansing, satisfying meal replacement. Get to know chia seeds. These miraculous little seeds are a form of easily digestible protein that is full of minerals, vitamins, and soluble fiber. Rich in omega fatty acids, and similar to flaxseed, chia seeds have the significant advantage of being more stable."
5003951~If rice pudding is getting a little too comfortable, try our version with fresh pineapple, mango, and papaya.

5003965~In Turkish cookery there's a distinctive group of dishes known as güveç, which take their name from the earthenware pot in which they are cooked—in the same way that the tagine does in Morocco. In rural Anatolia the cooking pots may be sealed and buried in the ashes of a fire to cook slowly overnight—or, only slightly less romantically, in the local baker's oven. If you don't have a clay pot, a heavy-based cast-iron casserole dish will serve almost as well.

5003982~Texas cowboys and cowgirls dip their egg sandwiches in this stuff for breakfast, they dunk their fried onion rings in it at lunch, and they cover their broccoli with it at dinner. It's the ultimate dipping sauce for cold pizza, the perfect accompaniment to crudités, and—oh, yeah—it's also a salad dressing. Once you learn how to make your own ranch dressing, you'll save yourself a fortune on the stuff. And it's really easy. You can even use yogurt instead of sour cream to make a low-fat version. Add some minced herbs from your garden if you like. Chives are another great addition.
5003983~For this recipe the lamb racks are frenched all the way down to the eye of the meat. For decorative purposes, we asked our butcher to leave a 1-inch-wide strip of fat along the top of the eye of the rack.

5003986~Start with grilled country bread spread with olive paste, or olivada, available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets. Or puree pitted, black, brine-cured olive oil in a processor.
5003987~For this recipe we call for a 13 1/2- by 4- by 1-inch rectangular tart pan with a removable fluted rim; you could also use an 8 1/2- by 1-inch round tart pan (both have about a 3 3/4-cup capacity).

5006712~Mushrooms made from meringue are the traditional edible decoration for a Yule log cake, and their cute quotient is high—they never fail to charm young and old alike. Saying they're edible is like calling a chocolate truffle edible; if you love crisp meringue, you'll adore the crunchy, airy contrast the mushrooms provide for our creamy Tiramisu Yule Log cake. Classically they're made from a white meringue, but we couldn't resist coloring ours with a little added cocoa to make the mushrooms look like cremini or baby bellas.

5018340~This is our basic vinaigrette, three parts oil, one part acid, pared almost to its essentials—no shallots, no salt and pepper—so that it can be used almost like a sauce base. The mustard adds flavor and strengthens the emulsion. Any number of additional ingredients may be added to it, depending on how it's to be used. Most often it's used to dress greens that have been seasoned with salt and tossed with fresh herbs, as with the Bibb Lettuce Salad .

It makes sense, then, that many of the same ingredients feature prominently in both cuisines. These potatoes, grilled with a mustardy aioli (basically, garlic-scented mayonnaise) and served with a scattering of herbs, would be at home on either region's table. Delicate parsley, chives, and tarragon are known collectively as fines herbes and are a staple of Mediterranean cooking.

5004042~Every Passover, my maternal grandfather, Irving, made beet horseradish from scratch. He was a gardener with a true green thumb when it came to tomatoes, but I can't remember if he grew his own horseradish. What I do remember is how teary-eyed everyone got when he served my grandmother's homemade gefilte fish with his beet horseradish on the side. Through the sniffles, we all expressed delight and assured him that this batch was the hottest and best yet. Horseradish is one of those flavors I have always loved. For all you other horseradish lovers out there, here's a fabulous dip. Use extra-hot prepared horseradish to guarantee those sniffles and teary eyes.
5004043~This updated classic adds dashes of red — and depth of flavor — to the usual apple, celery, and walnut mix. Make the salad ahead and refrigerate, then add the watercress and pecans right before serving.

5004046~Food editor Maggie Ruggiero was humming for weeks after enjoying a salad of fresh buffalo mozzarella, cucumber, and the Italian wheat called farro at the Manhattan restaurant Il Buco. She set about reimagining it, and her versions accents—tender lettuce, basil, and a light, lemony dressing—beautifully complement the cheese. Since fresh mozzarella is the star here, it's essential to use the best you can find. We love the kind traditionally made in Italy from the milk of water buffalo for its custardlike texture and sweet, milky tang. Recently, some American producers have gotten in on the act as well.
5004047~This odd recipe makes some of the most moist, succulent, flavorful barbecued chicken I've ever tasted. The secret: an open can of beer is inserted into the cavity of the bird, which is cooked upright on the grill. Besides being incredibly tender, the bird makes a great conversation piece. The recipe was inspired by the Bryce Boar Blazers, a barbecue team from Texas I met at the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest. The proper beverage? Beer, of course.
5005201~Chef Rathbun's method of roasting a turkey involves brushing the skin and packing the cavity with butter, then starting the roasting at a relatively high temperature — 450°F. As the turkey browns, the butter and turkey fat melt and pool under the grate, eliminating the need to add water to the pan juices. After 40 minutes, the oven is turned down to 350°F and the buttery drippings are used as a basting liquid. This technique seals in the bird's natural juices, producing crisp, golden skin and moist meat.
5004049~Use the ripest purple-fleshed plums available to intensify the flavor of this pretty summertime treat.
5004050~Try these alongside egg dishes at brunch or with soup and salad for lunch.
5004051~Get the most out of every ingredient by layering flavors. Roasting portobello mushrooms before adding them to the lasagna lends a meaty smokiness.
5004052~Theres nothing quite like making your own granola. You can toss in as many nuts and fruits as you want and sweeten it to your taste. While the possibilities are endless, we love this honey-sweetened variation with sesame seeds. The cardamom clings to the almonds, dried apricots and pears, and oats, adding an exotic touch.
5012005~Serve with mustard-seed-crusted pork medallions.
5004054~If you're using reactive metal molds for your panna cottas, make sure there are no rust spots — the acid in the buttermilk and the fruit will react to the exposed rust and cause the panna cotta to discolor. We had the best luck with molds made of nonreactive materials such as stainless steel, glass, and ceramic.
5007265~This spiced-up blend is perfect for dipping and also serves as the ultimate multipurpose sauce for chicken, beef, pork, and seafood.
5004056~Pineapple adds sweetness and a tropical twist to this classic cocktail. Make sure to choose a ripe one: It should be very fragrant, with no soft spots or bruises. Or use fresh precut pineapple.
5004057~The flavors of this tart are remarkably balanced—it's a bit savory and a bit sweet. (In fact, in the south of France, where it's known as tourte aux blettes, you'll often see the pastry served for dessert.) Paired with a simple salad, it makes for a supremely satisfying light dinner.
5004058~Cranberries add sparkle to the meal.
5004059~Dried porcini give this vinaigrette a huge boost of flavor and marry beautifully with the asparagus and goat cheese for a spring-like first course. Serve this dish with sharp knives (like steak knives) so the toast and asparagus cut easily.

5004060~This time-honored example of kitchen thrift is ready when you are: Have it simmering away while you tend to another meal or are puttering around on a Saturday morning. Just looking at it in the refrigerator or freezer will make you happy, secure in the knowledge that you can put a terrific meal on the table in no time at all.
5014769~This recipe was created to accompany Ginger Cakes with Molten Chocolate Centers and Ginger Crème Anglaise.
5004062~Start this romantic supper with Russian caviar and ice-cold lemon vodka. The main course is a simplified but impressive interpretation of the Russian fish pie known as kulebiaka, which the French call coulibiac. Offer Champagne with the entrée, and finish the meal with babas au rhum from a French bakery to complete the cross-European elegance.
5004063~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004064~Highly recommended!
5004065~Pairing chick-peas and Swiss chard is nothing new—Armenians have been doing it for generations. But with great tomatoes and a squeeze of lemon, this quick vegetable stew is as fresh as summer. If you can’t find Swiss chard, spinach is an authentic substitute.

5004074~Imported or domestic tuna packed in olive oil is a staple in my pantry. I make quick tomato sauces with it, use it on sandwiches, and especially in salads. This is a great main-dish salad, with tender tuna and crunchy, spicy radishes. Serve it on top of lettuce with crusty bread on the side for a substantial no-cook meal.

5004110~The North African hot sauce called harissa lends this soup its beautiful brick-red color, as well as a deep, spicy warmth that isnt the least bit aggressive. For a supper thats both robust and rejuvenating, chard, chickpeas, and noodles go into the pot, too.
5004111~If you've never thought of roasted squash as a side dish, try this recipe. Just rub pieces of butternut squash with olive oil, salt and pepper and bake until their flesh is tender and roasted to tawny gold. Serve the squash the way it's eaten in country houses in the part of the Emilia-Romagna region where nearly every family makes its own balsamic vinegar. Small bottles of balsamico are set out on the table, and everyone seasons their squash to taste with the vinegar. Try the squash with grilled lamb chops, roast chicken, pork and simple sautéed fish dishes.
5015078~One taste of this smooth, supple butter sauce, and you'll understand why it's a French classic.
5005024~Boning the roast makes slicing the meat much easier at serving time: Have your butcher remove the backbone, or chine, from the whole rack and cut the meat off the ribs in one piece, then tie the meat back onto the bones. The roast can be served on or off the bones. To crack whole peppercorns, enclose them in a resealable plastic bag and crush slightly with a meat mallet. What to drink: A medium- to full-bodied red with peppery spice, such as Syrah (called Shiraz if it's from Australia).
5004114~Highly recommended!
5004115~This fun dessert magically turns store-bought ice cream into bread with a little help from self-rising flour. The butter pecan ice cream does double duty, adding caramelly sweetness and nutty crunch.

5004135~Why you'll make it: Because it's that dinner-party dish that's as do-able as it is drop-dead gorgeous. Call your meat market ahead to order a boned, butterflied leg of lamb, and ask that the thickness be as even as possible (two to three inches thick). Start the lamb the day before; it needs to be refrigerated overnight covered with the rub.
5004136~Classic taste, new look. The borders puff up beautifully to keep the filling in place.
5004137~Green apple and a dash of cider vinegar provide just the right amount of tart balance in this slightly sweet, down-home soup topped with homemade bacon bits.
5004138~For toppings, provide some diced avocado and extra chopped cilantro.
5004139~If you can't find Cabrales cheese, substitute Roquefort or Danish blue cheese.

5004157~A layer of sliced fried plantains forms the crust; picadillo — a Latin dish of ground meat, tomatoes, and spices — makes a savory filling. This would be a lovely supper with bread and a salad.
5004158~Persian in origin, this soufflé is wonderfully airy, and the eggplant is infused with garlic and lemon. Think of it as a warm, puffy baba ghanouj.

5004165~This pasta is a complete revelation. The sauce is magically made from the pasta water and tomatoes as the pasta cooks—all in one pan. No fuss, one pan, and a killer bowl of pasta. Pasta and gluten sometimes get bad press. I think there is a time and place for a good bowl of pasta. Saying that, I opt for interesting pastas as often as I do the traditional kind. Try corn, chickpea, or buckwheat spaghetti—they are gluten-free, and all have incredible individual flavors and make a welcome change if pasta is a staple in your house. The key to this recipe is to measure your water carefully and to use the right pan: you need a large, shallow sauté pan or casserole large enough to fit the pasta lying down. A large, deep frying pan or wok would work well too.

5004182~"Country-style ribs are not actually ribs. This cut of meat comes from the shoulder of the pig, where it is sliced in
half under the blade bone and then cut into long strips to resemble ribs. As a result, much like other tough cuts of
meat, country-style ribs benefit from any type of low and slow cooking. Tender, tangy, and accented with just a hint
of bourbon, these ribs are a messy, saucy affair. Bone-in country-style ribs are recommended for this recipe since it’s
the bones that are packed with the most flavor (you can use boneless ribs, but they may require less cooking time)."

While latkes (potato pancakes pan-fried in oil) are traditional—and we've never met a latke we didn't love—why not end the meal this year with apple fritters that are as tender and delicate as cake doughnuts? Drizzled with an orange glaze, they echo the flavors of the winter season.
5020106~Egg whites give these quick, cheesy nibbles their exceptionally light texture. Bite-size portions make them the perfect mouth-popping accompaniment to an aperitif.
5004187~This simple, delicious dish hails from China's Shanghai region. It's a great way to use up leftover rice—if your rice is already cooked, you'll need 3 cups of it.

5015611~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5004193~Shrimp get a wake-up call from a bold spice paste that really packs a punch. A brief 30-minute swim in the marinade imbues the shrimp with intense flavor—jalapeño, ginger, and garlic lend heat, while garam masala contributes depth. Sparkle comes from a splash of lime juice. Think of the mango chutney as a fresh Indian salsa; it's crunchy, colorful, tart, and very refreshing.

5004231~When we lived in San Diego, we used to walk through dozens of neighborhoods where we found fig, pomegranate, and citrus trees everywhere. Nothing beats the delicate flavor and juicy texture of a fresh, ripe fig-nothing except for maybe the dish. While fresh figs aren't highly accessible for most people, dried figs can usually be found at just about any market. We use dried figs here to create a dish that reminds us of those summer evening walks when we would score a bounty of fresh figs. Served with spicy toasted walnuts and smothered in a sweet and silky sauce, this dish is sure to become a family favorite.

5004250~Hominy, or hulled corn kernels, is the backbone of this Mexican soup (pronounced poh-SOH-lay), which can easily be made vegetarian by using vegetable stock and omitting the pork. Either way, it's best garnished with lots of cilantro, cheese, and lime and served with warm flour tortillas.
5004251~Romanesco cauliflower — with its cone-shaped florets — has a more subtle, nuanced flavor than traditional varieties. The size of Romanesco cauliflower can vary widely, so we call for weight in this recipe rather than number of heads.
5015854~Team the fish with steamed rice and sautéed spinach, and pour a Sauvignon Blanc.
5004253~Highly recommended!
5004254~Though the healthful and now mainstream Middle Eastern dip we know as hummus typically includes chickpeas and sesame tahini, this adaptation contains neither. Rather, its similarly smooth texture comes from the natural starch and protein of the English pea. In the summer, I make a variation of this using blanched field peas of any variety, and I substitute thyme for the spring herbs and fresh garlic in place of the early green garlic of spring.
5004255~I purposefully made this beef marinade super powerful. With this hors d'oeuvre, you only end up with a little mouthful and the peppery flavor needs to come through loud and clear. In the catering company, we shave the beef into small pieces which are then piled onto the crostini, so you can easily bite through without too much effort.
5004256~We love the color and texture you get from using a combination, but any single root vegetable can be used here, too.
5004257~If black cod isn't available, a firm white fish, such as halibut or barramundi, would also work well.

5004260~Flips were originally hot drinks made with egg and a variety of liquors and wines. They were warmed up by means of a loggerhead, an iron tool with a long handle and bulbous end that could be heated and plunged, like a poker, into the drink. Today, however, flips are generally served cold. Historically, they have been most often served in the morning or at bedtime, because of their soothing character.

5004271~"""Recently I had dinner at a fine restaurant with a peculiar name: The Place Next to the San Juan Ferry,"" says Beth Fogarty Day of Redmond, Washington. ""It's right by the water in Friday Harbor, Washington. I'd love the recipe for the mushroom and goat cheese appetizer."""
5004272~"""Never met a fritter I didn't like, and I love this one."" —Allie Lewis Clapp, food editor"
5004273~The perfect date dessert is one that's interactive: Candied strips of orange peel, fresh raspberries, and crisp almond cookies are all flavorful enough to stand up to a silky dark-chocolate fondue spiked with a shot of warming brandy.
5017005~Highly recommended!
5004275~We thought of this dish as a main course for lunch, but it would also be great for dinner, particularly with grilled steak. (Serves four as a starter or side dish.)
5004276~We seasoned this salad — based on the Middle Eastern bread salad called fattoush — with za'atar, a mixture of salt, sumac, sesame, and thyme.
5004277~Add corn bread, a crunchy chicory salad, and peach pie for summer supper at its best.
5009981~Highly recommended!
5004279~This impressive frozen dessert has a crisp gingersnap crust, cool mango and lime sorbet filling, and refreshing fruit topping.
5004280~Fruit with a spiced wine syrup is a typical — and refreshing — ending to a hearty Spanish dinner. Serve with slices of lemon sponge cake if desired.
5004281~Begin making this treat a day ahead.
5008966~Be sure to clean the grill rack thoroughly with a metal brush to remove any bits of grilled food that might impart an off flavor to the cake. Reheat the cake on a baking sheet in a 350°F oven before serving.
5004283~Juicy peaches, crushed cookies and vanilla ice cream spiked with brandy and amaretto add up to a perfect summer treat.
5004284~Only one more fruit is added to this vibrant red applesauce, yet its fragrance and tastiness seem to triple. Smooth and elegant, it complements roast meats and makes a wonderful dessert on its own.
5004285~Any leftover compote is great served over vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt.
5014511~For extra convenience, make this a week ahead and freeze. Thaw in the refrigerator.
5004287~Chinese five-spice powder adds a complex, spicy note to this cake.

5004294~"At a dinner at an Italian vinoteca, on the dessert menu was something I'd never seen before: ricotta-stuffed eggplant with candied orange and chocolate sauce. My curiosity piqued, I placed an order with the waiter, only to have him come back with ""You won't like it. Order something else."" Not one to be easily swayed from ordering an intriguing dessert, I ordered it in spite of his admonition, and you know what? I liked it—quite a bit, in fact."
5004295~This classic French dish is originally made without cheese. It is the starch from the potatoes, and the cream and milk, which give the dish its cheesy taste while the leek and garlic gently infuse their flavors into the potatoes. Of course if you prefer you can add some grated gruyère to the top along with the cream.
5004296~Active time: 45 min Start to finish: 1 hr
5004297~"Quinotto de Hongos y Camarones
This dish—quinoa prepared risotto-style—is so good, you'll forget it's good for you. Quinoa, whose name means ""mother grain,"" is indigenous to Peru and dates from the time of the Inca civilization. Compared with other grains, quinoa is very high in protein and relatively low in carbohydrates. If you're pressed for time, we found a great substitute for fresh clam broth."

5004310~Plank cooking is a Native American technique that imparts a subtle smoky flavor to fish, meat, poultry, and vegetables. It is recommended to use a plank of untreated Western red cedar made specifically for cooking purposes.
5004311~Enjoy this dessert at room temperature if you like a creamy texture similar to that of a soufflé, or serve the cake cold if you prefer a dense, fudgey texture.
5004312~"This showstopper is a worthwhile project. Set aside some time 2 days ahead to make the components, then practice saying ""Aw shucks, that was nothing!"" to raving guests."
5004313~Chilaquiles en Salsa de Chipotle
5017226~The beauty and subtlety of wild garlic makes this dish very appealing, and fresh curry leaves add a fragrance that is quite seductive. During the summer months we pod fresh coco beans and cook them directly in the curry until soft. In winter we soak dried cannellini beans overnight and precook them in water for an hour or so over gentle heat, with one or two herbs added for flavor. I like to serve this curry just as it is, but you could add chunks of white fish to it.
5004315~Made with crisp radishes, salty olives, and feta, and dressed with minted olive oil and lemon, this salad really sings.
5018247~You'll use this mixture to sweeten all three gelati. But the syrup is also useful for sweetening iced tea, fresh fruit drinks, and flavored cocktails.
5004317~This may be an unusual combination of ingredients and flavors for empanadas, but the pairing of cabbage, blue cheese, and walnuts is a classic that makes a wonderful cold-weather dish. While these empanadas would serve as a delicious and hearty vegetarian main course with the addition of rice and beans, I love these flavors with pork.
5004318~Baby bok choy ranges in length from 3 to 5 inches. It's harvested young, and its tender texture makes it ideal for steaming, boiling, or stir-frying. Here, the finished dish has a nice nutty aroma from the sesame oil drizzled on at the end. Any number of stir-fries, including Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork , would benefit from having this simple vegetable dish on the side.
5004319~Highly recommended!
5004320~A coating of egg and panko (rather than a heavy batter) makes these lighter than the average fish stick. Plus, theyre sautéed rather than deep-fried.
5004321~For this interactive dinner, use a camping or induction burner at the table, or just get cozy around a warm stove. As the broth cooks the chicken and vegetables, it becomes a flavorful homemade soup.
5004322~Called tzatziki in Greece, this yogurt sauce can also be used on a baked potato as a nonfat alternative to sour cream. To prevent the pita bread in this recipe from getting soggy, place the trimmed portion of the bread down into the pocket to act as a sponge for the lamb drippings and yogurt.

5004327~The flavor of the wine looms large in this meaty braise, lending an extraordinary savoriness to the melt-in-your-mouth carrots.
5004328~It's a pain, but you have to peel the kohlrabi for this recipe. Take off enough of the purple or green skin to reveal the inner white flesh.
5004329~Highly recommended!
5004330~Red-braised pork may be one of the most common of all Chinese dishes, but it is also one of the most glorious, a slow stew of belly pork with seasonings that may include sugar, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine and spices. Every region seems to have its own version: this is my favorite, based on recipes I've gathered in eastern China. If my experience is anything to go by, you won't have any leftovers. My guests tend to finish every last morsel and usually end up scraping the pot. If your guests are more restrained, leftover red-braised pork keeps very well for a few days in the refrigerator and a good spoonful makes a wonderful topping for a bowl of noodles. I don't recommend freezing it, however, as this ruins the delicate texture of the fat.
5004331~Highly recommended!
5016101~Highly recommended!
5004333~Passover falls at the cusp of spring, and fresh asparagus on the table is one of the best ways to usher in the new season. Combined with the snap of green beans and sautéed with the silky, mild bite of green onions, it becomes a welcome pop of color and texture to the plate.
5004334~Although this cake, used in the grilled coconut pound-cake sundaes with tropical fruit, calls for flaked coconut, don't be tempted to omit the coconut extract — it really adds depth to the coconut flavor.
5004335~Highly recommended!

5015010~"Suzanne Rushing of Cannon Beach, Oregon, writes: ""On a recent trip to St. Louis, my husband and I went to Harvest restaurant twice because we were so impressed with the food. I would love to have the recipe for chef Stephen Gontram's wonderful chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and herb-roasted tomatoes."""
5004338~Start this dish at least 4 hours ahead. The chicken can also marinate overnight. What to drink: A delicate white wine with floral aromas, like Pinot Gris from Austria or Alsace.
5004339~This candy-like tart with hints of rose, orange, and cloves was inspired by the delicate flavor of baklava. Serve it on its own or with honey-sweetened strained plain yogurt.
5004340~Highly recommended!
5004341~Though you could certainly use regular red cherries in this recipe, we prefer yellow cherries such as Royal Ann or Rainier, available in supermarkets, for their lovely yellow color, as well as their bright flavor and mild sweetness.

5004352~This classic Swiss potato pancake and the Green Bean and Red Onion Salad are great together. Serve dry Champagne throughout the meal.
5008518~As important as it is to develop feel and instinct when making dough, there is a metric formula for making pasta all'uovo. The Bolognesi love them. For every 100 grams of flour, use 1 50–55 gram egg (net weight, i.e., without the shell), which corresponds to 1 USDA medium egg. Your kitchen scale is almost certainly bilingual, and it is much easier to use the metric system for this than fractions of ounces, but it works out to 1 3/4 to 2 ounces of egg for every 3 1/2 ounces of flour.
5004354~While this easy curry is super satisfying served over rice or with naan, we wrapped it in some leftover crepes for a convincing dosa-like experience.

5004361~The lavish efforts involved — the vegetables are braised, then marinated, and finally sautéed — result in a succulent savory casserole that's spicy with pepper and juniper berries and sweet and sour with cherry nectar and vinegar; each vegetable gives the sweet and sour a slightly different twist. The chestnuts, cooked with salt pork, are particularly wonderful, salty and satisfying. Begin preparations at least 7 hours ahead of serving, since the vegetables must marinate for 6 hours.
5004362~Highly recommended!

5004367~In Big Timber, a town of seventeen hundred people just northeast of us, lives Susan Pauli, a great gal and wonderful cook who is in great demand as a caterer. She makes this unusual summer creation as soon as the local watermelons have ripened. The pink color is gorgeous, and the salad travels well. Who would have thought that feta cheese and black pepper together would enhance the taste of watermelon?
5004368~Rosemary's piney scent is so particular you could never mistake it for any other herb. A handful of sprigs (left over from Beef Sautéed with White Wine and Rosemary ) mingle with garlic to cast a spell over roasted potatoes, resulting in something that's just right on a winter night.
5004369~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5004371~Although we prefer the taste and texture of sheep's-milk ricotta, this recipe can be made using (whole-milk) cow's-milk ricotta, which should first be drained overnight in a cheesecloth-lined sieve set over a bowl. The grapevine leaves make for a beautiful presentation, but, because they haven't been softened in water, they should not be eaten.

5004378~An added pleasure of this salad lunch is that you can mix your own. Take a large tray and line it with grape leaves or large flat leaves of leaf lettuce. In the center place a shallow dish piled high with heart leaves of lettuce, watercress and spikes of French endive. Around this dish, on the grape leaves, arrange fruits according to your liking, such as:
5004379~Grated lemon zest gives this creamy classic a hit of bright flavor and a little added flair.
5004380~The fried eggs add extra unctuousness to a clever carbonara.
5004381~A diced confetti-style hash is a great way to use leftover meat and vegetables.
5004382~Avgolemono, a classic Greek sauce flavored with lemon juice and thickened with eggs, adds richness to the tender stewed chicken in this outstanding main course. Pour a chilled Chardonnay, and offer purchased baklava for dessert.
5004383~Since roasting brings out the best in most vegetables, food editor Melissa Roberts decided to throw the potatoes into the oven along with the garlic and parsnips, their companions in this dish. The result is an earthy mash, with chunks of caramelized parsnip and savory-sweet garlic.
5004384~If you've never made a savory custard, now's the time. Start with this minimal and delicate Japanese version, studded with fresh peas and tender shrimp.
5004385~All of the ingredients that make gazpacho so yummy — tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, and bell peppers — turn up in this main-course salad.

5004392~Highly recommended!
5004393~It's only natural to use leftover chicken broth (from Blade Steaks with Rosemary White–Bean Purée ) to make chicken soup. But what a soup! Steeping ginger and scallion greens in the stock and then poaching the chicken in it is a quick way to achieve a depth of flavor. The final soup is enriched with silky ribbons of just–cooked eggs, shreds of tender chicken, and fresh rings of scallion. Best of all, this satisfying soup is easy enough to pull together after work.

5004397~The squid in this entrée is tender and picks up the flavors it's cooked with.
5004398~Using sun-dried tomatoes that are not packed in oil cuts down on fat. You can find them at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores and Italian markets.
5004399~To serve as a drink, freeze until just slushy but not solid. Look for Angostura bitters in the liquor section of the supermarket.

5004404~One of the best ways I know of serving a dish the second time around is to dress up the leftovers in tortillas, bake them in a spaghetti sauce, and top them with crunchy stuff. Even a picky kid might not recognize last night's dinner — if you're lucky.
5004405~Highly recommended!
5004406~The slow-sipping, mellow character of bourbon has always suited my palate, in a glass and as an ingredient. Compared to the sophisticated, somewhat standoffish refinement of brandy, bourbon is sturdy and straightforward in the kitchen. Always searching for a way to use bourbon, I've discovered that its sweet, no-nonsense flavor is perfectly at home in this garlicky glaze where it adds depth and a sweet edge to the taste. The recipe makes enough glaze for two racks of spareribs, but it can be doubled if you need more. Serve with collard greens and baked sweet potatoes.
5004407~A high roasting temperature caramelizes the pan drippings, adding fantastic flavor and color.
5004408~This dish is emblematic of great home-style Southern cooking. Some say its origins are in Europe, where wiener schnitzel was invented, and there are some similarities. The connection ends, though, with the country-style sausage gravy with which we smother our pan-fried cutlets. Europeans serve their version with a humble (and lean) wedge of lemon. I retained the gravy but lightened it up dramatically���and instead of pan-frying the cutlets in bacon fat as they do in some parts of the South, I chose to bread and bake them.
5004409~The Beranbaum family fell in love with this pie at a diner called Big Boy in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. We were addicted to this pie, consisting of a crisp crust filled only with fresh strawberries held together by a fruit juice glaze. We would drive fifty miles to Big Boy every weekend just to have it. When I tried to duplicate it in my kitchen, I discovered that a fruit glaze also works well with fresh raspberries or a mixture of raspberries and currants. The glaze preserves the freshness of the fruit for two days.
5004410~Highly recommended!
5004411~A century ago, spicy English mustards like Colman's were too pungent for American tastes, even in small quantities: Back then, mustard was used only in salad dressings. George French came along in 1904 with a formula for a milder condiment he called French’s Cream Salad Mustard. Eventually slathered on everything from bologna sandwiches to soft pretzels, French’s mustard is also delicious in this barbecue sauce.
5004412~Highly recommended!
5004413~Be sure to accompany this with plenty of crusty bread to soak up the rich broth.
5004414~Highly recommended!
5004415~We like to think of the summer roll as an elegant example of fast food: a salad packed into an edible container—in this case, paper-thin rice sheets—which results in something as beautiful to behold as it is practical to eat by hand. Better yet, the summer roll is a big win for the health-conscious because the roll is almost fat-free, and the sauce, while sporting a little peanut butter, is not highly caloric. One dipped bite yields an explosion of flavors and textures that's guaranteed to excite any palate.
5004416~"A word of warning: I have a friend who at first refused to eat this dish because of its color, a wild, alarming fuschia. He complained that it did not look ""natural."" Since then he has been persuaded. The taste, he said, won him over."
5004417~Highly recommended!
5004418~Instead of using a pastry bag to pipe the meringue for the baskets, just snip a corner off a resealable plastic bag. Begin preparing this one day ahead.
5017327~Editor's note: Chef, nutritionist, and cooking teacher Lourdes Castro shared this recipe from her cookbook, Latin Grilling. It's a classic Cuban dish and the centerpiece of a festive party menu she created for Epicurious. If you have leftover pork, Castro recommends making Grilled Cuban Sandwiches .

5004422~Brush this slightly sweet lime-scented sauce on shrimp or chicken before and during grilling. The recipe makes enough for 1 1/2 pounds of chicken or shrimp, with some left over to pass at the table.
5004423~Highly recommended!
5004424~A great sauce to serve with tongue , this is essentially a mayonnaise, but the egg yolks are cooked instead of raw. I like to make a lot and then keep it in the refrigerator to eat with cold ham too. It's also good as a salad dressing.
5004425~Russet potatoes are the classic choice for baking but also are best for frying. Because they’re high in starch and low in moisture, they make crisper fries. And don’t refrigerate potatoes for frying; the sugars that accumulate cause very rapid browning and the fries can turn bitter.
5004426~With its use of dried porcini in the turkey rub and fresh shiitakes in the light gravy, this recipe from the late food writer Michael McLaughlin is a fine example of his signature style: deeply flavorful seasonal cooking. You can make the turkey stock for the gravy up to two days ahead.
5004427~This quick soup, an American classic, makes a fine pairing with a grilled cheese sandwich or crisp romaine salad. Here the grilled cheese sandwich takes a different form—a souffléed Cheddar topping on a good piece of toasted sandwich bread. Use an organic brand of tomatoes, one that's thick with puree as well as chunks of tomato.
5004428~Look for peanut sauce in the Asian foods section of the supermarket. Serve with: Couscous and a cucumber-romaine salad tossed with mint-yogurt dressing. Dessert: Mango sorbet and coconut macaroons.
5004429~You can use any kind of crab, or even dip lump crabmeat in the sauces.
5004430~"""Hey. Hey. I'm Frank, the Conch Salad Man. I'll sell you the world's best conch salad!"" He was holding a huge white pickle bucket brimming with his conch salad. With no more explanation than that, he reached in and gave me a paper cup full. I tipped back a mixture of finely diced conch, tomatoes, red onions, Scotch bonnets, bell peppers, celery, citrus juices and herbs. The flavors of the sea were in there, too. Living in Key West was my culinary university; I never needed more formal training. The place was filled with honest, in-your-face flavors that came from the Cuban, Bahamian and African-American residents and wanderers who passed through. I didn't move to Key West to re-invent the cuisine—I came to find a home. In the process, I found a path to both. In this recipe, you will taste the foundation of each."
5017258~Cardamom is a spice not commonly used in the United States. A member of the ginger family, this warm, sweet spice is traditionally found in Indian cooking, flavoring a wide variety of curries, rice dishes, and Indian-style desserts.

5004437~{sweet and toothsome} Roasting is a no-fuss way to put a lot of vegetables on the table. Roasting brings out the natural sweetness in fall root veggies and winter squash. Roast them in big batches to top Baked Risotto , and throw them into fall and winter salads.

The fried shallots provide an irresistible savory crunch.

5004450~Learning to cook octopus properly is important because it can become a bit rubbery if not prepared correctly. This recipe teaches a great technique. The richness of the aged balsamic vinegar, the brightness of the peach, and the peppery bite of arugula come together in a harmonious way that celebrates all of the flavors, especially the octopus.
5004451~We love the way this cooking method lightly chars the bok choy and intensifies the natural sweetness and juiciness of the shrimp. And roasting them together leaves you with plenty of time to whip up a gently spicy, savory batch of kimchi rice to serve alongside.

5004458~While apple pie has an all-American reputation, both the fruit and the dessert are of European origin. However, several centuries of apple cultivation and dessert baking have given us de facto ownership, and the pie has become a must on many Thanksgiving tables. Cheese was produced by many of the German dairies in and around Philadelphia. The pie has no bottom crust and is baked in an oval dish, so it resembles a cobbler.
5019938~A habanero chile gives these onions a nice bit of heat.

5004466~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004467~The goat cheese, when tossed with the hot pasta, melts and becomes a creamy sauce. We've learned that it's a good idea to taste your goat cheese before using it (or before buying it, if possible — one of the soft goat cheeses we tried seemed a bit too strong for this dish).
5004483~Highly recommended!
5004469~Orange chicken is a Chinese-restaurant favorite for good reason. Think of it as a Chinese-American version of fried chicken nuggets coated in a savory citrus sauce punctuated with a light touch of chile heat. What's not to love? Making it at home—instead of resorting to takeout—is much easier than you might think, and probably involves about as much time as it takes to find the menu online and wait, wait, wait for the delivery.

5004476~A standard at health food restaurants across the country, carrot cake was ubiquitous in the seventies. Grated carrots made it a nutritious choice, or so the thinking went. This ultra-moist version is updated with a maple icing.
5014270~Stew made with lamb may be known as the national dish, but beef is actually the most popular meat today. It turns up everywhere, including Tinakilly House in Rathnew, Ireland, where they offer this lovely dish. It's served with Champ (Green Onion Mashed Potatoes).
5004478~Use almost any combination of fresh herbs here (watch the tarragon, mint, and sage, since they're more assertive). Accompany this meatless dish with a salad (maybe arugula and radicchio with a red wine vinaigrette) and some seeded breadsticks. Then add a rich dessert, such as an almond tart from the bakery.
5004479~Highly recommended!
5004480~This recipe originally accompanied Lobster Curry.
5012191~There's quite a bit of lore surrounding beer-can chicken, and for good reason. Just look at that burnished mahogany bird. The steam from the brew flavors the meat and keeps it moist. The can props the chicken up, so it roasts evenly—no scorching, no flipping, no stressing. And you get to drink some beer. We're believers.
5014498~"Rice is a staple of Latin cuisines, and growing up in a Cuban family, I probably took it for granted. It was only when I left home that I realized how important well-cooked rice can be, both for the soul and other foods on the plate! I always try to impress on people that it's a sin to use converted or instant rice. It's got to be ""real"" rice, and preferably long-grain. Avoid flavoring rice, for that will detract from the flavors of the foods you're serving the rice with."

5004486~This cumin- and paprika-spiced number gets added punch from an addictively tangy green sauce and a crisp, bright avocado and cucumber salad. Spatchcocking—an easy and fun technique that involves removing the backbone to “flatten” the bird before cooking—makes for quick roasting and produces juicy results.
5004487~Serve this with plenty of crusty bread.
5004488~"Eli Gorelick of West Orange, New Jersey, writes: ""As a kid growing up in Cuba, I worked alongside my mother every day in the kitchen, learning how to make specialties like picadillo and fried bananas. I still think Havana has the best Cuban food in the world, and I continue to love the recipes I learned during my childhood."""
5004489~At Mirabelle, chef Reuge serves the paillards, in this case thin slices of strip steak, on a bed of red cabbage braised in red wine and garnishes the dish with fresh herbs.
5004490~Studded with delectably nutty wheat berries, this substantial salad of charred tomatoes, peppers, and tofu truly deserves its billing as a main course.

5004494~Some say it isn't soul food unless it's mashed, creamed, candied, or deep-fried. But Southern cuisine needn't swim in saturated fat: Witness the recipes in Dr. Ro's Ten Secrets to Livin' Healthy (Bantam Dell Books) by nutritionist Rovenia Brock, Ph.D. With this delicious down-on-the-Delta dish, Brock slashes the fat while upping the nutritional ante with picks high in vitamin A, beta-carotene, and lycopene. You get a meal that's good for your heart and soul.
5016308~This recipe was created to accompany Chilled Tarragon Tomato Soup with Vegatable Confetti .
5004496~A caldin is a coconut curry, typical of Goa. Though caldins are made with fresh coconut milk in India, chef Cardoz uses Chaokoh brand canned unsweetened coconut milk. It's thicker and richer than other brands, and imparts a great deal of flavor. It's important not to let the caldin boil during cooking, or the coconut sauce will break.
5004497~It is very easy to overcook pork chops. In this recipe,you can first sauté them until brown and then add a little broth to maintain their moisture. Open a bottle of Gamay Beaujolais to have with dinner.

5004505~This fruit butter makes a quick dessert. It's also a great snack on bread or toast. We use it in a low-fat recipe for a moist and chunky apple butter spice cake. We have found preserving in half-pint (250 mL) jars convenient, since that recipe calls for that amount of apple butter. But if you use larger jars, you'll have lots left for other uses.
5004506~A blend of cumin, chili powder, and cinnamon gives this dish its Moroccan flair.
5004507~Highly recommended!
5004508~Don't let the humble name fool you. These little cookies are bursting with flavor. They're reminiscent of those fig cookies you had as a kid-raised to the third power. The cream pastry is tender and flaky, and the honey-kissed filling, just sweet enough, is deepened by plump Medjool dates. They're also bite-size and adorable.
5004509~Highly recommended!
5004510~A very moist, fudgy brownie.
5004511~Highly recommended!
5004512~We love how Carena uses every part of the duck: The carcass makes a velvety broth for braising the wings and legs until they're fall- off-the-bone tender; the breast is seared and sprinkled with minced parsley and garlic, so the dish really runs the gamut from deeply meaty to fresh and vibrant.
5016677~Silky and sweet, these onions add a sophisticated touch to adults' burgers (adventurous younger eaters will enjoy them, too).
5004514~Use a sharp vegetable peeler to shave the Parmesan cheese into long strips.
5004515~To make this slightly sweet dish such a delicious departure from other melon soups, Kinch briefly cooks vibrant Cavaillon and Charentais melons. Feel free to use any of your favorite summer melons, including honeydews or cantaloupes.
5004516~For rave-worthy soups, skip the store-bought stock. You can extract a cleaner, stronger broth from a combination of water and several pantry ingredients. It's all about layering powerful flavorenhancers that you probably already have on hand—bacon, tomato paste, herbs, peppercorns, a Parm rind, and, of course, kosher salt.

5004526~My editor, Maria Guarnaschelli, suggested this recipe, based on her memory of a savory pie served at a London pub. One half of the pie was filled with pork and the other with apples. As I later learned, that dish has its roots in an eighteenth-century workingman's lunch called the Bedfordshire Clanger—a hand-held pie filled with meat on one end and jam on the other. It was a compact way to serve lunch and dessert in one package.
5004527~Serve with: Buttermilk biscuits with herb butter, and chilled steamed asparagus spears in a citrus vinaigrette.
5004528~Keep the feast eco-friendly by buying Mid-Atlantic sea bass and not its overfished southern Atlantic cousin.

5004534~The Indian staple cornmeal became a mainstay of Colonial cooking; European arrivals used it to stretch their scarce wheat flour. We have adopted the same tactic with our modern edition of the venerable breakfast dish, pancakes. They are, of course, also a good excuse to bring out the maple syrup, another gift from the Indians.

5004548~This refreshing mint syrup can flavor any combination of fresh fruits. Leftover syrup is great for sweetening iced tea.
5004549~Tamales are traditionally served in the southwestern United States and in Mexico at Christmas. In this easy do-ahead version, corn husks are wrapped around spicy pieces of pork tenderloin. The husks keep the pork tender and juicy as it cooks. What to drink: Pinot Noir.

5004556~Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to lower cholesterol, and it is about as healthy as fish can get. But that is really a side benefit to this great-tasting main-course salad. It fits into the Motivating Mondays scenario, but I would happily serve it any day of the week and for any occasion. The warm orzo salad, with crunchy pine nuts, fresh basil, tender spinach, and tangy feta, is also good on its own. The salmon can also be cooked in a ridged grill pan.
5004557~"This wheat loaf is nothing like your standard ""health bread"" — the oats make it soft and slightly sweet, ideal for sandwiches or buttered toast."
5004558~This beautiful side dish looks complicated but is very easy to assemble. If you don't have time to make your own ricotta, buy high-quality fresh ricotta.
5004559~Cooking the garlic inside the skin not only saves time but also mellows the harshness of its flavor and results in tender cloves that can be peeled easily. Squeeze the cloves out of their skins and eat them with the chicken and the bread.
5020022~The ricotta needs to chill for about two hours. Consider making it the night before so the ricotta is ready to go when you assemble the carpaccio.
5004561~Go light on the salt when seasoning these chops; the marinade is fairly salty, especially after it reduces.
5004562~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5004564~This unusual dish — which combines biscuits, tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese — is a cross between a meatless lasagna and a pizza bread. It's a terrific quick supper; just add a mixed green salad.

5004566~Highly recommended!
5004567~Golden crisp on the outside yet tender on the inside, here is the ultimate in French toast. The additional egg yolks give extra richness, body, and color to this twist on the classic. This recipe is perfect for entertaining because it's made the day before. Simply fry and serve in the morning.
5004568~Sticking the cloves into the tangerines means no straining is necessary before serving. Enjoy pre- or post-dinner.

5004571~It is said that eating Hoppin' John on New Year's Day will bring good luck. Here's a fresh take on the southern dish traditionally made with salt pork (we've subbed in andouille sausage) and served over rice.
5004572~Brisket is commonly used to make corned beef, but I find that it lends itself well to other preparations. And once it's in the oven, you can forget about it for hours—it's that easy to prepare. This brisket with a south-of-the-border kick is one of my very favorites. The meat actually tastes better to me when it sits overnight so all the flavors have more time to marry. It will hold well for a few days. While good reheated the next day, the meat served cold in a sandwich is a delicious alternative to leftovers.

5004598~Cocoa, espresso and orange add a sophisticated note to a classic pecan pie.
5004599~A sensuous variation on the theme of bread and chocolate is a silky ganache flavored with a garlicky Cuban-style olive oil mojo, smeared over slices of Cuban bread. Because the ingredients are so few and basic, it is important to use a not-too-bitter premium chocolate. I also like the effect of a mellow Spanish extra-virgin olive oil made with Arbequina olives, with their slight accent of apple peel. Sea salt sprinkled on the bread right at the moment of serving brings out all the flavors.
5004600~Create endless riffs on this salad by using the bright herb dressing with your favorite grains and vegetables.
5004601~Ripe tomatoes, basil and fresh corn enhance a terrific side dish.

5004605~Watermelon chunks in savory salads have been all the rage in the past few years, but we wanted a way to retain the fruit's best trait: how enjoyable it is to eat out of hand on a hot day. These wedges, sprinkled with salt, pepper, cheese, and heady fresh mint, are a light, refreshing start to a warm-weather meal. And they leave your other hand free to hold a drink or chase after the kids.
5018731~This well-known Philippine starter combines attributes of many of the wrapped foods of other countries. It's filled like an egg roll, has an egg wrapper like a crêpe, and is served warm but not fried. All the components, which can be varied according to what you have in your kitchen, are cooked before assembly.

5004620~We serve this sauce with both the sugar snap pea tempura and the pork and jicama dumplings . If you make only one of these hors d'oeuvres, however, this recipe should be halved.
5004621~Lovers of beef and chorizo can have their steak and eat it, too: Here, a garlic, cumin, and smoked-paprika rub on rare roast beef has the alluring smoky meatiness you've always associated with the richly flavored sausage. The same seasonings, plus some drippings from the meat, transform ordinary store-bought mayonnaise into a simply spectacular accompaniment.
5010834~You can make this stock with a variety of fish carcasses (from nonoily fish) or with just one type — whatever your seafood market can give you. This recipe makes more stock than you'll need for the fideos with mussels , but leftovers can be frozen and used for soups, stews, and sauces.

Raw egg is typically mixed into the hot pasta, but a poached egg on top feels more substantial while still providing the requisite creaminess.
5004629~Highly recommended!

5004648~Fresh kernels of raw corn are so sweet and tender that they don't need to be cooked. Their natural sugars and crisp juiciness pair wonderfully with the salty Parmesan and peppery arugula.
5014185~This may be my favorite accompaniment in the book. It's wonderful on pretty much everything, especially Buckwheat Crepes or Whole-Grain Buttermilk Pancakes, or stirred into The Very Best Oatmeal. Ricotta is traditionally made from the whey that's left over from the cheese-making process, and it's often extremely mild. This recipe brightens the simple cheese with a combination of honey, vanilla, and lemon zest¿transforming it into a light morning topping that could rival any high-end yogurt or jam.

If you don't have a roasting pan large enough to hold both briskets, divide the ingredients in half and bake in two pans. If the veal is difficult to find, substitute one 5-pound flat-cut beef brisket and roast until tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Leftovers freeze well and make great sandwiches.

5004679~More supermarkets are carrying fresh rabbit, as people rediscover its delicate flavor. Braising helps to keep it moist and tender. If you have trouble finding rabbit, however, you can substitute bone-in chicken, skin removed.
5004680~This lightly spiced drink (which is similar in flavor to chai) is packed with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, thanks to a dose of peppery turmeric. A touch of honey adds just the right amount of sweetness, while the ginger and black pepper add a little heat.
5004681~A lot of people assume that being healthy means that red meat is off the menu. But I'm delighted to say that it's very much on mine. That said, I am a stickler for ensuring that the meat we eat is of the highest quality and that it is always paired with an abundance of vegetables. Plants are always my main focus, but a little bit of good-quality meat here and there has worked best for me. I have tried being vegan and vegetarian but my health suffered during those phases. We are, after all, omnivores and so, unless you have a specific dislike of, issue with or reaction to meat, I think it's a food group that has an important role in our diet. If you like carpaccio, this recipe also works incredibly well with the beef served raw and very finely sliced.

5004683~After lingonberry preserves, these pickled cucumbers are the most popular condiment in Scandinavia. They are a traditional accompaniment to Swedish Meatballs, simple salmon dishes, and roasts and other meats.

Radiating the aromas of toasted cumin and coriander, and spiked with the salty-sour pucker of cured lemons and olives, it produces a heady and exotic effect. If you can’t find preserved lemons in your local food markets (high-end stores usually stock them), you can order them or make them yourself.
5004692~Offer grilled zucchini slices and a deli pasta salad alongside. Dessert? Berry tartlets from the bakery.

5004694~This just might be my all-time favorite dessert. It's the simple essence of sweet apples and crisp pastry with no distractions. We've all collected several similar recipes over the years, but this is the best one I've ever made. If I need to make it even faster, I use defrosted frozen puff pastry instead of making the crust (see note), but you'll want to eat it an hour or two after it comes out of the oven.

5004704~This recipe was created to accompany Cornmeal Cake with Sweet Rosemary Syrup and Blackberries. Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004705~Kale goes by another name, one much more dashing, especially in Italian. Cavolo Nero, black cabbage, may not evoke superhero status, but it's close. Kale does seem invincible and it's known to make the eater more so, too. It's also called dinosaur kale (also called lacinato), maybe because its leaves look like the back of a lizard. Those thin knobby leaves squeak. Do not confuse cavolo, accent on the first syllable, with cavallo, accent on the second, or you'll be ordering black horse, and in certain parts of the world will find it. Hearty and good for the spirit. I like soaked and cooked cannellini better than canned ones.

5004708~"Michael McLaughlin, cookbook author, says, ""Not all Thanksgiving traditions originated decades ago. This recent addition to my holiday menu lineup was inspired by my move to Santa Fe. With locally grown green chilies readily available and pine nuts growing on piñon trees right outside my back door, a southwestern-style stuffing incorporating both ingredients seemed a natural. The tequila-soaked raisins are a sweet surprise."""
5004709~Posto, cardamom pods, and whole dried red chiles are available at Penzeys (800-741-7787; penzeys.com) and Kalustyan's (800-352-3451; kalustyans.com).
5004710~"""On a visit to Key West, Florida, I had a superb dinner at Camille's Restaurant,"" writes Patrick Wessels of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ""I was especially impressed by the creamy Gorgonzola cheese sauce they served over roast pork tenderloin."""
5004711~Fingerlings have a particularly earthy quality that tastes of the essence of potato. Steaming them, rather than boiling, preserves their delicate shape and prevents them from becoming waterlogged, so that the simple dressing really comes through.

5004715~Nuts, lemon juice, and fresh herbs punch up this terrific side dish.
5008021~"Also known as Korean-style or cross-cut short ribs. We fell in love with this bone-in cut at Korean BBQ joints and are therefore partial to its Korean name (and flavor possibilities). Buy 2 pounds of cross-cut short ribs, each sliced lengthwise about 1/3"" thick."

5004725~This bistro classic is enriched by rounds of smoky, spicy sausage. All you need is a leafy salad and a glass of red wine. The French green lentils that we prefer are prized for their finesse; they also hold their shape better than some other varieties and are less starchy.

5004731~Peeling spring's fleeting fresh fava beans takes some time, but the results are well worth the effort. You can blanch and peel the beans a day ahead.
5004732~"Called bianca, or ""white,"" because they are sauceless, these crispy pizzas are the essence of clean flavor. The toppings are added after the crusts come out of the oven, melting the cheese slightly. This recipe makes two round pizzas or four rectangular ones."
5010229~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5004734~The olive oil-and-cheese dressing is a nice alternative to drawn butter.
5004735~Tamale pie, made with a cornmeal-mush crust, dates back to 1911. In this recipe, we use ready-made polenta packaged in a roll. The spicy beef filling takes advantage of the excellent bottled salsas and canned refried beans now crowding market shelves.

5004755~White chocolate adds a rich, creamy sweetness to this quick pumpkin mousse. Be careful to keep the white chocolate and pumpkin mixtures warm as you mix them; otherwise, the white chocolate can set as it mixes into the pumpkin. If this happens, simply return the mixture to the microwave and gently reheat. Serve it alone or as part of our Build-Your-Own Thanksgiving Pie Bar.
5007545~For an elegant change of pace from store-bought tortilla chips, fry thin slices of plantain at home. When slipped into hot oil, the plantains curve into beautiful, long strips. Delicately flavored and impossibly crisp, these chips are great for dipping in guacamole.
5004757~Our neighborhood pizzeria, Gialina, gets high marks for its thin-crust pies and the impeccable produce that chef-owner Sharon Ardiana uses in her toppings and sides. Her salads are always irresistible, and this one is not only delicious, it also uses whole kale leaves, including the stems. Ardiana tosses chopped raw kale with bright rounds of sweet carrots, creamy avocado, and a handful of nutty farro for sweetness and texture, and then adds a garlic dressing that is reminiscent of green goddess dressing but without the mayonnaise.
5004758~Wishy-washy greens needn't apply: A gorgeously balanced symphony of peppery and bitter greens, cut with a lemony vinaigrette that makes the feta go creamy, and an occasional pop of sticky, sweet date, this is sure to become your go-to salad all summer long.

5004764~This homemade cereal is hearty, wholesome, and filled with nutritious ingredients such as walnuts, rolled oats, raisins, and sunflower seeds. Granola is very flexible, so you can add whatever fruits and nuts are your personal favorites. This granola is great with milk or yogurt, or even as a topping on pancakes. Because raisins can make the granola soggy, we add them right before serving. The granola keeps well for a long time, so this is a big batch—it makes three pounds. Just keep it in an airtight container and eat it for breakfast all week, as we do at Bubby's or cut it in half to feed a smaller crowd.
5004765~This recipe makes much more dough than is needed for the Mushroom and Butternut Squash Empanadas with Smoked Chile and Tomatillo Sauce , but it freezes beautifully, wrapped well in plastic wrap and sealed in a plastic freezer bag. (Defrost the dough in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours before using.) At Café Azul, Archibald also uses this pastry for pies and tarts.

5004776~Tender veal shanks get great depth of flavor from lecsó, a kind of Hungarian sofrito of sautéed onions, frying peppers, and tomatoes, to which paprika and, in this case, stock are added. (Grimes found that Cubanelle peppers are the best substitute for the long, yellowish-green peppers found throughout Hungary.) Finished with sour cream, the sauce yields more than you need, but you'll be happy to have leftovers to serve over noodles, chicken, or pork.
5004777~Cooked gently over a low heat, lamb shank becomes meltingly tender—perfect for an elegant, restorative broth.
5004778~To prepare these without an ice cream maker, pour the sherbet base directly into pop molds. If you don't want to use the molds and you have churned the mixture in an ice cream maker, the sherbet can be transferred to a resealable container, then simply scooped into bowls. Begin making this dessert one day ahead.

5004787~Although several varieties of basil are used in Southeast Asia, the most common-called rau que in Vietnam and bai gaprow in Thailand-is generally referred to as Thai basil in Asian markets on this side of the Pacific. The leaves are slightly darker and narrower than the more familiar Italian basil and have purple stems and flowers. Rau que has a distinctively pungent anise flavor, but Italian basil is a perfectly acceptable substitute.

5004790~Serve with: Mixed baby greens with shredded radishes in a citrus vinaigrette, and a sesame baguette.

5004808~The yogurt in this recipe adds lightness and a mild tangy flavor.
5004809~Carrots, braised in chicken broth and combined with shallots and fresh herbs, make a beautiful addition to the table, especially when you take advantage of the different-colored varieties found at farmers markets. You will also appreciate how small amounts of seasonings turn a taken-for-granted vegetable into something splendid. Don't reserve the recipe just for Thanksgiving; it would also be delicious with pork chops or a roast chicken.

5004814~Resist the temptation to toss together all the squash with the oil, salt, and pepper. If you don't do it in batches, as noted below, the salt will draw out too much liquid from the squash waiting to be roasted, and the casserole will be soupy.

5018247~A little sugar never hurt anyone. But make sure you're only having a little—and not the whopping 40-plus grams in a can of commercial pop—by using simple syrup. The sweet base for many homemade sodas lets you control how much sugar goes into your drink. Start with just a small amount—a tablespoon has 8 grams of sugar—adding more as desired.
5004833~If you can't find burrata, substitute fresh whole-milk mozzarella.
5004834~Tender chunks of lamb served kebab-style are paired with a traditional Mediterranean-inspired salad in this simple grilled dish.
5004835~A cucumber and red bell pepper relish and a pilaf made with fragrant rice (like basmati) are perfect partners for the lamb. For dessert, have coconut ice cream topped with sliced bananas.

5004850~Though there are plenty of chiles in this paste, they don't overpower it. The aromatic bite of coriander, the earthiness of cumin, and the licorice trace of caraway seeds create a pleasingly complex flavor. This paste is also delicious with pork.

5004855~This simple rice salad combines hearty parsnips, toasty hazelnuts, sweet orange segments, and crispy Little Gem lettuce for a bright, refreshing dinner. Creamy whipped ricotta finishes the meal with rich, filling protein. The trick of quickly boiling rice makes this recipe more weeknight-friendly.

And the pickled fennel? You won’t believe how good it tastes either.
5004865~You cant go wrong with a traditional bread stuffing, especially when its enlivened with fresh sage and celery leaves. Broad chunks of baguette, golden and crisp on top, soak up turkey stock and buttery juices from the sautéed onions and celery.

But since I started my new job, I don't have as much time to hike, ski, or enjoy my other favorite activity — cooking. Spending time in the kitchen has now become a luxury. Instead of making a complete meal in the evening, I prepare ""single-girl food"" — namely cookies, grilled sandwiches, and egg dishes. But I don't use that expression negatively. I never miss an opportunity to share a batch of cookies with my friends."""
5004874~These savory tartlets are similar to quiches.
5004875~This is one of those ingredient combinations that, like the Little Black Dress, always seems to be in style, and it's no wonder: earthy, sweet beets, sharp and creamy blue cheese, and bitter greens simply go together beautifully. Skillet-Toasted Quinoa provides additional texture and protein. Like Chimichurri, this vinaigrette's flavors grow more robust if allowed to sit at room temperature for at least 1 day.

The recipe makes more allspice syrup than you'll need, but the extra will keep for up to three weeks and is delicious in glögg or a Tom & Jerry It can also be served as a nonalcoholic beverage, sans Scotch."

5004915~We think all turkeys are improved by brining (soaking in salt water), but it's a cumbersome task that few holiday schedules can accommodate. We find kosher turkeys, which are salted during the koshering process, to be just as flavorful and succulent as brined ones, without all the fuss.

5004920~"""On the last night of a holiday in Costa Rica, my sweetheart and I had a candlelit dinner at Café Mundo in downtown San José,"" writes Elizabeth Florence of New York City. ""We dined on the front porch of a Victorian house surrounded by tropical flowers. The chocolate cake we had that evening was just incredible. Would chef and owner Ray Johnson part with his recipe?"""
5004921~"Food editor Maggie Ruggiero learned this method of cooking artichokes from a close friend of hers, Betty Alfenito, ""prop stylist and cook extraordinaire."" We love the wonderful pan sauce it yields, as well as the way it infuses the artichokes with a subtle hint of garlic."
5004922~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004923~"This combination of two all-time favorites is based on our New Orleans—style egg-soaked-and-fried pain perdu, or ""lost bread,"" a traditional method used to reclaim bread that was growing stale. I use fresh challah—thickly sliced or it will fall apart during the soak—because it has a rich sweetness but airy texture from being kneaded. The long soak creates a custard that cooks into the bread so it puffs up in the oven after getting a crisp crust in the frying pan. That's your base, topped with the saltiness and smokiness of bacon with a good cure, ripe tomato, and peppery arugula."
5004924~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5004925~I leave the skin on the breasts so I can stuff the herbs and garlic underneath.
5004926~Line the tortilla press with plastic and the dough will peel right off.
5004927~"Fine-grain bulgur, sometimes labeled ""good for tabbouleh,"" is essential to this recipe, because coarsely ground bulgur will not soften when soaked in boiling water. A late-season tomato salad or sautéed cherry tomatoes with Indian flavors complete this meal."
5004928~Inspired by a style of cake from California's Miette bakeries, we frost the top and middle layers of this stunner but leave the sides naked to showcase the almond cake. Don't have a pastry bag or star tip to frost the layers? Fill a resealable plastic bag with the frosting, snip off a corner, and pipe away.

5004935~Bacon and maple are a classic combination. Here, the dynamic flavor duo teams up in a sweet-and-salty maple sauce studded with caramelized bacon. The sauce is spooned over ice cream and sprinkled with toasted pecans to create the ultimate sundae. Serve any leftover sauce with pancakes or waffles.

5004939~For the best flavor, use an artisanal root beer made with cane sugar (not corn syrup). We like Faygo and Fitz's, but many more options are available online at sodapopstop.com.
5004940~This tartlet is complex, but well worth the effort. It sprang from the mind of our bakery's apple-obsessed chef, Eric Wolitzky (he is from the apple heartland of upstate New York), who was attempting to wring more flavor from the traditional apple pie. Were still huge fans of the classic, but this version—with its perfect ratio of caramel to apple to buttery crust and crunchy topping—is now our must have apple dessert. At the bakery, we put the tartlets out at noon, and they are gone by 12:30 p.m., so we feel fairly confident that people share our new obsession.
5004941~Chop these Calabrian-style chiles into pasta sauce or sprinkle onto pizza.
5017528~Couscous is easy to cook—just add it to boiling water, remove it from the heat, and let it stand for a few minutes until the water is absorbed. The addition of cinnamon, lemon peel, garbanzo beans and golden raisins gives this side dish a Mediterranean flair.

5007456~This marshmallow frosting recipe was inspired by one of my favorite cookbook authors, the late Elaine Gottschall. It works especially well with S'mores and is divine frosted over Chocolate Cake or sandwiched between Chewy Chocolate Cookies.

5005001~If I entered a competitive-eating contest, it'd be one for pancakes. I like mine crispy edged, yet soft and tender inside. After years of tinkering, I've found that the best way to get this texture is to start with a fresh pancake batter, but you don't even have to make it yourself. (I love the buttermilk-based Robby's pancake mix available at RobbysPancakeMix.com or Amazon.) If you can, let the batter sit overnight in the refrigerator to hydrate and swell—that extra time makes for the fluffiest pancakes, I promise you. I love the play of the sweet maple syrup with the creamy, slightly bitter nature of the coffee butter in this recipe.

You can substitute a firm-fleshed round fish such as branzino or black sea bass. Serve the fish flaked off the bone with the potatoes and a simple arugula and tomato salad.
5005024~Boning the roast makes slicing the meat much easier at serving time: Have your butcher remove the backbone, or chine, from the whole rack and cut the meat off the ribs in one piece, then tie the meat back onto the bones. The roast can be served on or off the bones. To crack whole peppercorns, enclose them in a resealable plastic bag and crush slightly with a meat mallet. What to drink: A medium- to full-bodied red with peppery spice, such as Syrah (called Shiraz if it's from Australia).

5005032~"Sometime during the first year of my marriage, I visited my mother-in-law in her kitchen. There she was, listening to the radio, whistling (she is a formidable whistler) and rolling cream cheese dough around raisins and nuts to form the crescent-shaped cookies known as rugelach. I was spellbound—I'd had no idea that rugelach could be made at home. As far as I knew, rugelach, like ketchup or ships-in-bottles, were only made in laboratories. But here was my mother-in-law shaping the cookies with ease. And a short time later, there I was, eating them with ease. These cookies weren't like the rugelach my mother bought every week at the local German bakery—they were much better. I was so excited I asked for the recipe.
My mother-in-law wrote it out in her precise hand on a 3-x-5 index card. And, as she wrote, she told me that this recipe was not exactly the same as the one her mother used, that it had come from Mrs. Strauss, her next-door neighbor, and that she was sure I'd have no problem making the cookies as long as I didn't overmix the dough.
She was right. I was a newcomer to the world of baking, but I had no problem with the dough, the only potentially tricky part of the process.
Since then, I've made rugelach countless times, but nowadays my dough is even more foolproof because I make it in a food processor. I've also made a few other changes to the recipe. While my mother-in-law's rugelach were filled with cinnamon-sugared nuts, mine also include a slick of jam, some currants and a handful of chopped chocolate. This is a very old recipe, and I have no doubt that everyone who has made it has added or subtracted a little bit to make it her own—and my mom-in-law, Mrs. Strauss, and I expect you to do the same."

5005049~Creamy coconut tapioca pudding with glazed pineapple is one of the desserts I obsessed over when I lived in New York City and worked for François Payard. All of the cooks at Payard Patisserie spent our free time talking about the places we dreamed of going and the dishes we couldn't wait to try. One of the cooks told me about how Claudia Fleming, at the time the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern, had created a dreamy tapioca that could not be missed. He was right—on one of my last nights in NYC, I was finally able to try it, and thereafter every time I went to visit NYC, I made a point of going back to order it again. Sadly, it's no longer on the menu, but I've channeled it here in this version. It's light and refreshing and uses the natural sugars of mango, pineapple, and apple juice to complement the richness of the coconut milk.

5005135~This cold sesame noodle dish is one of the most popular dishes in Chinese restaurants. My family recipe is simple, made with readily available ingredients. It's a great blank canvas for adding all sorts of leftover proteins. I have made the dish with shredded roast chicken and duck, as well as sliced pork and beef. Sesame paste, often referred to as tahini, can be found in health food stores or the international foods aisle of your supermarket. If you can't find it, try unsalted 100 percent pure peanut or almond butter, which will give you different, but equally tasty, results.

5005140~Homemade ravioli are well worth the effort, and making them is the perfect task to share with a kitchen full of cooks (even novices can get in on the fun). Mixing the pasta dough is a breeze in the food processor, but if you don't have one, don't worry — we've given the method for making the dough by hand as well. A brown-butter pine-nut sauce is light enough to let your efforts on the pasta really shine through.

5019226~Use to prepare Corn Bread and Chestnut Stuffing, or enjoy this on its own.
5018231~This is another wonderful all-purpose salsa. It goes particularly well with eggs and any dish containing black beans. The essential technique in this recipe is the blackening of the tomatoes. That and the chipotle chile give the salsa its deep, smoky flavor.
5012829~"What could possibly be better than a strawberry milkshake? A strawberry cheesecake milkshake! The cream cheese, which has a tang of its own that's enhanced by the lemon zest, helps make this milkshake as thick as, well, concrete (the very apt Missouri term for a milkshake).
If the idea of frozen strawberries hits you as totally counter to your locavore sensibilities, know that they are another secret to a milkshake thick enough to eat with a spoon, and if you grow your own or buy them at the farmers' market, we urge you to freeze them for this shake. You'll find the directions in the Cooks' Notes at the end of the recipe."

5017506~Highway 84 runs from Santa Fe to Colorado. About forty minutes north of Santa Fe, the highway cuts a paved path through Ohkay Owingeh, a Native American reservation, and the roadside becomes dense with fast-food outlets, outposts of national grocery chains, Walmart, and billboards for Ohkay Casino, Hutch and Norma Naranjo's sprawling midcentury home is set about fifty years back from the road, a shrine to the tug-of-war between new ways and traditional ones. In the backyward Mr. Naranjo built two hornos (behive-shaped adobe ovens). Inside the house, a handmade wreath of dried chiles hangs on one wall and a string of made-for-tourists ceramic peppers on another. A naïve painting of St. Francis hangs not far from a cluster of the dream catchers that the couple and their two grown children fashion from string, feathers, and yarn, just as their Pueblo ancestors did.

5015008~This recipe for turkey gravy is part of the Thanksgiving menu Chef Kent Rathbun created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program. He serves it with Rosemary-Roasted Turkey .
5005201~Chef Rathbun's method of roasting a turkey involves brushing the skin and packing the cavity with butter, then starting the roasting at a relatively high temperature — 450°F. As the turkey browns, the butter and turkey fat melt and pool under the grate, eliminating the need to add water to the pan juices. After 40 minutes, the oven is turned down to 350°F and the buttery drippings are used as a basting liquid. This technique seals in the bird's natural juices, producing crisp, golden skin and moist meat.
5005202~Highly recommended!
5005203~This pasta is tasty made with kale, collards, or any greens you have growing in the garden. I will go and cut whatever is ready or use what I brought home from the farmers' market. I like to include something that has a bit of spice, such as broccoli rabe, red mustards, or mature rocket. Many times I will cook more greens than I need and put them in the refrigerator to make a quick pasta another time. (Add the garlic and goat cheese at the time you are going to toss them with the pasta.) This is perfect for those days when dinnertime shows up before you know it.
5005204~Most kids will like the dressing, but you might want to put it on the side just in case. Serve pink lemonade to the kids; the grown-ups might prefer iced tea or sangria.
5016746~Many years ago, I worked with a cook who introduced me to this method of roasting pork with milk and fresh orange. Jose has long since retired to his little pueblo in Michoacan, but his recipe lives on in my kitchen simply because it so delicious. Pork cooked this way is moist and succulent, sweet from the natural caramelization of the milk, with the slightest hint of orange and black pepper. For an over-the-top garnish, crumble chicharrón (fried pork skin) on the soft roast meat for a porky, crunchy textural contrast. Serve the carnitas with warm corn tortillas, avocado, a crisp raw tomatillo salsa, and plenty of onions and cilantro. If you have access to heirloom pork such as Kurobuta or Berkshire, it's exceptionally delicious—pork the way pork was meant to taste.

5005214~The brisket tastes best if prepared ahead, so make it at least one day and up to two days before you plan to serve it. Chilling the brisket makes it easier to slice. Rewarm the meat in the sauce and serve with a full-flavored dark beer (see our suggestions below).
5005215~"Buckwheat — which grows well in cold climates — has a solid place in French-Canadian cuisine. Buckwheat crêpes can be traced back to Brittany, and buckwheat pancakes are a regular part of a Canadian breakfast.

5005227~Cut the bread into cubes to offer with aperitifs, or serve it cut into strips with a salad. It tastes best the day it's made. The day after, try it toasted and topped with butter. For best texture, make sure the dried pears you use are plump and moist.
5005228~This cake and custard sauce can also be made ahead. Both should come out of the refrigerator, to take the chill off, when the first course is served. The accompanying caramelized pears, which require not more than a few minutes to sauté, make a welcome addition to the cool custard sauce and moist cake.

5005263~Let this be the dish to make a kale lover out of you. If you are a fan of creamed spinach, there is no way you won't fall head over heels for this dish. The same luscious flavors are all in play; the creamy sauce is spiked with onion, garlic, and a touch of nutmeg. Changing the leafy green from spinach to kale is a seemingly small substitute with a big impact. Like spinach, kale is packed with nutrients, but unlike spinach, it doesn't melt into the sauce; its texture is sturdier and retains its body when cooked. Crispy shallots bring another layer of texture along with their mild onion flavor.

5005358~"Think gnocchi are too time-consuming to make during the week? Think again! These rustic dumplings get their super-soft texture from a combination of pumpkin, ricotta, and Parmesan cheese that comes together quickly in the food processor. The gnocchi cook up fast thanks to this awesome hack: Instead of tediously rolling the dough by hand, pipe it directly from a pastry bag into the boiling water, using a piece of butcher twine tied across the pot to ""cut"" the dough into pieces."
5005359~Highly recommended!
5005360~Adding Dijon to this sauce lends not only a nice kick but also body and richness—without resorting to lots of cream and butter (a shocking idea in an issue that sings the praises of French food, we know).
5005361~Highly recommended!
5005362~Chicken thighs are an excellent choice if you're looking for big, meaty flavor that's easy on the wallet. Here, they're seared until the skin is golden-crisp and then roasted with the classic combination of lemon and oregano until juicy.
5005363~Panko breadcrumbs bring a nice crunch to this Italian Red Sauce classic.
5005364~Highly recommended!
5005365~If canned chipotles are not available, simply use the same amount of chipotle hot sauce. Tilapia, branzino, or petrale sole are other fish that would work in this complete meal.
5005366~A refreshing starter from Arrows in Ogunquit, Maine.
5012617~Martin Cate, owner of the rum-centric Smuggler's Cove bar in San Francisco, shares his spiced rum recipe below. The secret: Start with good rum, and don't overinfuse the mixture.

5009161~"The name of this Moroccan spice blend—an exotic mix of sweet, savory, and spicy—means 'head of the shop,"" implying that it's the store's best blend. Use it to season the Lamb Tagine with Chickpeas and Apricots (see recipe), as well as your favorite chicken or vegetable dishes."
5005370~At The Amana Barn Restaurant, in Amana, Iowa this dish is called Rouladen; it's accompanied by potato dumplings.
5005371~Cornmeal lends these crackers a golden glow and a nice crunch; lots of crushed green peppercorns (left over from Chicken Spice Rub ) provide an intriguing spiciness. Serve them with cheese or all on their own with cocktails.

5009638~Highly recommended!
5005375~Small pasta like acini di pepe and orzo make wonderful room-temperature salads, since they mix so thoroughly with the other ingredients and never go stiff. Garlic, olives, and chile flakes lend a lot of zip to this quick side dish you'll come back to all summer.
5019994~Mild tilapia takes beautifully to a robust, smoky cilantro-chipotle sauce.

5005382~Our food editors were split down the middle as to whether this cake was better when made with extra-virgin or regular olive oil. Using extra-virgin results in a fruitier, more pronounced olive-oil flavor, while regular olive oil yields a lighter taste. Both are delicious — you won't be disappointed with either result.
5006461~Highly recommended!
5005384~Artichokes are delicious, but they are also time-consuming to prepare. In this modern take on an Italian classic, frozen artichokes provide plenty of flavor with none of the prep time.

5015260~This creamy mixture of spinach, cheese and basil is an unforgettable side dish.
5010585~Although the marinade sounds similar to several of those given for tofu, it's just different enough that, when used on the completely different tempeh, you have a wholly distinct, and wholly delicious, dish. This is a base preparation. Use the baked tempeh as part of a component plate, sauced or unsauced, cut up as the filling for spring rolls with tempeh, added to a vegetable stir-fry, or as the centerpiece of a hearty sandwich.
5005402~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Rick Rodgers's book Kaffeehaus: The Best Desserts from the Classic Cafés of Vienna, Budapest, and Prague. Rodgers also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.

5005418~Traditionally, these Greek cookies, known as koulourakia, are formed into rings, twists and half circles. In this recipe, they are shaped into bow ties and twists, then glazed with anise-flavored honey. These are delicately sweet and nice with coffee.
5005419~This is best done on a large gas grill fitted with a thermometer — it's more labor-intensive to keep a charcoal grill at a constant high heat. You'll need a disposable roasting pan large enough to fit the turkey on a V-rack.

5005430~Serve these with extra lemon wedges.
5012869~You got your breast men and your leg men and your thigh men, but let me tell you something: I'm a wing man. What I love about wings is that you get a two-in-one treat when you eat them: Between the drumette and the flat, that's some good gnawing. Wings are great for weeknight cooking too, because they take very little time to prepare and cook.
5005432~Light cookies are filled with dessert-wine ice cream and fruit. The recipe makes about six cookies, so there's an allowance for breakage or extras for nibbling.
5005433~Standing rib roast is a special event; it's also surprisingly easy to make. This version gets a spice rub and a rich, earthy sauce that can be largely made ahead.
5005434~This is a great summer salad, perfect with all kinds of barbecue and grilled foods. It's also a wonderful way to brighten up a winter dinner of broiled chicken or beef.
5005435~This dessert is as impressive as it is simple. And any number of variations would be equally tempting. Try using a mixture of apples and pears, substituting ground ginger for the cinnamon, or sprinkling the warm tart with finely chopped pecans.
5005436~Tamarind paste, from a pod with a sweet-tangy pulp, is common in Hawaiian cooking.
5005437~"Here's a special-occasion roast enhanced with classic Provençal seasonings. Roasting two large ends of tenderloin instead of one whole piece ensures even cooking. (The meat needs to be coated with its aromatic rub, then chilled for at least six hours before roasting.) Serve this elegant dish with <epi:recielink id=""2999"">Scalloped Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Herbes de Provence</epi:recielink> and a sauté of green beans, zucchini and red bell pepper. Uncork a sophisticated Rhône red such as Hermitage or Crozes-Hermitage."
5005438~Colcannon, a classic Irish combination of mashed potatoes with cabbage or kale, is standard winter fare. If that sounds, well, boring, trust us, this version is anything but that. We freshen it up by cooking the potatoes and cabbage separately, then we make it easy to serve for a party by adding an egg and baking it in a pie pan, so that you can cut it into wedges.
5005439~Highly recommended!
5005440~Mild fillets get zing from a coating of wasabi mayonnaise.
5005441~If you crave the sweet maple candies sold at tourist shops, you need not wait until your next vacation to enjoy them. Maple syrup producers’ associations are eager to share these treats, and how to make them at home, to spread the gospel of pure maple syrup. This recipe is from the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association/Vermont Maple Promotion Board; the Massachusetts Maple Producers Association has produced a helpful video about making maple cream and maple candy. If you haven’t tried these maple candies, be forewarned: They’re like no other treat you’ve ever experienced.
5005442~Artichokes are a rite of spring and essential to Easter in Italy where you will see this member of the thistle family piled high on market tables. Trimming the artichokes does take time, but they can be braised ahead and reheated. Garlic and lemon are a no-brainer with artichokes, while the anchovy is the secret weapon that adds a deep savoriness to the vegetable without any hint of fish.
5005443~In this version of gremolata, garlic is omitted and rosemary and orange peel are added to the traditional mix of minced parsley and lemon peel.
5005444~This green pesto owes its intense and powerful flavor to the use of kombu. It’s such an easy recipe that you can experiment with the ingredients as much as you like. The arugula and basil, for instance, can be substituted with any leafy green of your choice. And the pine nuts can be replaced by any other type of nut, such as cashews or hazelnuts. You can even use sunflower seeds! Serve the pesto on crackers, on a grilled vegetable sandwich, or with a bowl of pasta.
5005445~Complement this thick soup with plenty of crusty French bread.
5005446~"""I have prepared the plum torte from Marian Burros’s The Best of De Gustibus many times, and I’ve also tried variations using different kinds of fruit,"" says Peter Wayne Gagnon of Pineville, North Carolina. ""My experiments helped me arrive at my own version of this dessert."""

5012015~"The juices from any roast—poultry or meat—caramelize in the pan, leaving a residue of brown glaze with intense flavor. In the process called ""deglazing,"" we melt these brown bits in hot liquid (wine, stock, and/or water), to create a quick sauce of concentrated natural essences. Make this pan sauce for either of our roast chickens."
5005457~In this recipe we call for a 10 1/2- by 7 1/2- by 1-inch rectangular tart pan. The tart could also be made using a baking sheet or a jelly-roll pan, as the filling is dense enough to hold its shape on its own.
5017939~You might be tempted to bake 2 sheets of cookies at a time in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Don't give in to this urge—the cookies must go in the middle of the oven to cook through and brown evenly.
5014912~Editor's note: Use this recipe to make Rawia Bishara's Eggplant Napoleon .
5005460~Thanks to the addition of some shrimp, coleslaw becomes a light main-course salad. Flaked cooked fish would also work nicely.
5005461~At The Riviera restaurant in Dallas, this delicious main course is teamed with steamed asparagus and fingerling potatoes roasted with rosemary.
5005462~Nothing beats the flavors of rich chocolate, refreshing peppermint, and luscious vanilla ice cream on a hot day. This pretty ice box cake comes together easily, thanks to prepared ice cream sandwiches and chocolate sauce, which also give it a stunning, retro look.
5017930~(San Francisco-Style Seafood Soup)
5005464~"""I return to Seattle's Cassis Bistro for the fine food and service,"" writes Eleanor O'Keefe of Seattle, Washington. ""In addition to the regular menu, there are always some fantastic seasonal specialties. I'd love to make one of their salads—it has dried cherries, bacon, and a blue-cheese vinaigrette."""
5005465~Highly recommended!
5005466~"To my way of thinking, the traditional way of serving hanger steak is the best. The steaks are quickly pan-roasted—they're best served medium-rare (although in France they're often served ""bleu,"" so rare that they're almost blue and only just warm in the center)—and sauced with shallots that have been cooked to a compote's consistency with red wine and vinegar and then tossed with butter and herbs. Whether you sauce the steaks or not (sometimes small bistros in France will serve the steaks with just a spoonful of butter and some sea salt or a pot of strong mustard), I hope you'll serve them with the greatest and most classic accompaniment: pommes frites, French-fried potatoes."
5005467~Highly recommended!
5005468~Brining the lamb before it is slowly braised results in flavorful meat.
5005469~Highly recommended!
5005470~When poaching eggs for a crowd, we've found the baking pan method below to be almost foolproof. Have a friend help you wrap the eggs in salmon before they get cold. If you're working on your own, you may want to simply drape the salmon over the eggs.
5005725~There will be plenty of leftover biscotti for afternoon coffee breaks.
5005472~For a savory addition, toss a little sautéed pancetta or bacon into this pasta.
5005473~This compote makes a lovely (and low-fat) dessert on its own, but the addition of ice cream and won ton strips makes it something special.
5005474~Butterflied lamb cooks faster and more evenly, and is easier to trim of fat and silverskin, than a whole leg of lamb. A butterflied leg has more surface area than a whole leg, so there's more flavor from the marinade and the grill. The lamb can be marinated up to 2 days in advance.
5005475~Highly recommended!
5005476~This is a fine dish for a cold day, and one that cries for ice-cold akvavit and beer. So popular is this soup with all the Nordics that it is said that the King of Sweden eats it every Thursday.
5005477~Cabbage is my new favorite vegetable chip—especially sprinkled with toasted caraway and dipped in yogurt.
5005478~Green beans and Brussels sprouts might seem like the Abbott and Costello of the vegetable world—lanky and straight versus roly-poly—but like so many odd couples, they go together beautifully. The key is to sautéthe vegetables so that they still have a little bite.
5005479~Highly recommended!
5005480~Compound butters are a great way to add flavor in a flash. Try your leftovers slathered on roasted vegetables or a seared steak.
5005481~This sweet-tart compote is made up of cooked kumquat and lemon slices and fresh blood orange segments.
5008529~Be sure to cook the beef just to rare or medium-rare. This way, the meat won't overcook or dry out when you use the leftovers in the other recipes.
5005483~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5005489~Jalapeño-Cilantro Salsa and Tomato Salsa are colorful accompaniments to this great entrée.
5005490~This satisfying fall salad uses familiar ingredients in unexpected ways.
5005491~Roasted fingerling potatoes would be great with this colorful dish. Ask the butcher to roll and tie the pork loin for you.
5016711~We love this recipe as much for the soy-glazed bonito flakes, with their maddeningly good smoky-savory-sweet flavor, as for making such great use of leftovers.
5009668~There is no dessert course in a traditional Japanese meal. Instead, pickles that refresh the palate are often the last thing eaten.
5005494~If you cut your carrots thin enough, you don't have to cook them to make great quick pickles; just pour hot pickling liquid directly over the carrots and let sit. For more visual punch, use multi-colored carrots.

5005506~Pears and Gorgonzola are a classic combination in Italy; here they team up in a unique pasta recipe. To make this intriguing dish even heartier, toss in some diced ham or cooked chicken.
5005507~"Joe Dion of North Charleston, South Carolina, writes: ""Because I work in a restaurant (I'm a chef at a place called Slightly North of Broad in Charleston), I don't let my cooking at home get too complicated. I'm at the restaurant five days a week and often work on weekends, but whenever I have the chance I enjoy getting together with friends and cooking for them."""
5005508~Highly recommended!
5005509~For best flavor and moist, juicy meat, brine the turkey for 36 to 48 hours. If you are planning to brine it in a cooler, plan on needing extra ice. Kosher salt is preferred in most brine recipes for its pure flavor and because it dissolves quickly.
5005510~"Bastoncini di Mozzarella Fritta
This great, very tasty appetizer could also be turned into a vegetarian meal. The Italian title says it's ""Roman,"" and that is how it has been named on most Italian American menus, but mozzarella and anchovies are a well-known combination in southern Italy. There are mozzarella-and- anchovy fritters; and zucchini flowers are stuffed with mozzarella and anchovies, then fried. In this recipe, the mozzarella is fried between layers of bread, and then topped with a puckery sauce of lemon, capers, and anchovy."

5005521~"Throughout France, these traditional fried cookies are called ""marvels"" for good reason. For crisp, golden results, be sure that the oil is hot enough before you begin."
5005522~Elegance doesn't come any easier than this treat made with purchased puff pastry.
5005523~In a Korean home or restaurant, grilled ribs (kalbi kui) would be accompanied by the spicy pickled cabbage called kimchi. It's available in the refrigerated foods section of some supermarkets and at Korean and Asian markets. For the ribs, have the butcher cut the flanken across the bones into 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Begin marinating the ribs one day ahead. What to drink: Asian lager.
5005524~Use regular broccoli instead of broccoli rabe for a more kidfriendly version.
5005525~Hearty accompaniments would be grilled or broiled bell peppers and portobello mushrooms and a basket of crusty wheat rolls. In the Italian tradition, offer grapes, biscotti and espresso afterward.

5005534~Homemade mayonnaise has a silkiness, an elegance, that you won't find in any commercial preparation. Making it by hand isn't hard (or time-consuming), but patience, constant whisking, and attention to detail are the keys to success.
5005535~Crispy fried shallots are an essential condiment in Vietnam. They turn up in soups and on salads, sprinkled onto dumplings as a garnish, and minced and added to meatballs. Crispy, sweet, and salty, they are indispensible. You may want to make double batches, as people have a hard time resisting the urge to snack on them. Strain the oil you used to fry the shallots and use it in other recipes or to fry more shallots. The strained oil, called shallot oil, will keep, refrigerated, for several weeks. The shallots should be used the same day they are fried.
5005536~Mashed potatoes and Green Beans with Warm Bacon Dressing (see recipe) are great side dishes. Follow with apple pie à la mode.
5005537~Though the presentation of this cake— all white-glazed and topped with undulating ribbons of toasted coconut—will take everyone's breath away, we promise that it will only get better from there. (And the cake's rich, coconutty, rum-nipped flavor will never hint that it was a one-bowl effort.)

5005545~Zabaglione is the Italian version of the foamy, custardy sauce known as sabayon in France. I found that freezing it for this dessert gave it a texture much like that of ice cream. For an extra-pretty presentation, garnish this with fresh raspberries, orange segments, mint leaves and additional sliced, toasted almonds.
5005546~Grits are often made with water, but the addition of whole milk—not to mention thick-cut bacon and fried eggs—turns a workhorse into a thoroughbred.
5005547~Pasties are savory turnovers. They originated in Cornwall, England, in the 1700s. During that era, tin miners took the portable pies into the mines for lunch.
5010319~Highly recommended!
5005549~By mid-decade, indulgence foods were back with a vengeance-a sign that too much of a good-for-you thing was starting to get boring at the dinner table. And when the diet gurus switched their focus from complex carbohydrates to protein, steak regained some respect from nutrition buffs. Also, many specialty foods shops began catering to the most health-conscious meat eaters by offering beef raised without hormones.
5005550~Highly recommended!
5007336~When creative director Richard Ferretti came to Gourmet two and a half years ago, he brought along a recipe for homemade fresh ricotta. It is more delicate in flavor than any store-bought version and has a lovely dry curd. Some of us make it at home often because it takes just a few minutes of active time. Topped with honey and cinnamon, it's also great for dessert.
5005552~Active time: 40 minutes Start to finish: 6 hours(includes making dough and cooling pie)

5005564~The creamy, butterscotchy goat's-milk caramel called cajeta makes this flan delicate and earthy all at once. Whipped cream balances the sweetness.
5005565~Highly recommended!
5005566~Though it's not a true ceviche, since the scallops are already cooked when they hit the marinade, the classic combination of refreshing citrus acid from orange and lime juice, heat from jalapeño, crunch from cucumber, and sweetness from the scallops themselves becomes even more intriguing with the added layer of flavor from the grill. This is the perfect way to start off this menu, as the bold marinade stirs up the appetite for the substantial main course.
5005567~Highly recommended!
5010090~"The dough gets its slightly tangy flavor from a ""sponge"" (a mixture of warm water, yeast, and flour thats allowed to ferment). Timing note: The sponge needs to rest overnight; the dough needs to rise for about eight hours."

5005573~"On the streets of Thailand, where the temperature sometimes soars over 100°, there's nothing more refreshing than a plastic bag of Thai tea! Since most of the tea shops don't have seating, the Thai people take their sweetened iced tea ""to go"" in a plastic bag with a straw sticking out of it. The flavors of these teas were the inspiration for this dessert. The thing that makes this dish so special is the lime in the caramel, which adds an unusual tang to the sweetness. Another bonus is the crunch and spice of the cashews that are sprinkled over the top of the pudding, adding a wonderful surprise."
5005574~This simplified version of a classic party dish will add some welcome heat to a winter night.
5013189~The beauty of this American classic is its adaptability, as it can be almost endlessly enhanced. If you wish, use one of the variations below or experiment to create your own specialty.
5005576~Cauliflower, enhanced with toasty almonds and a briny parsley-olive mixture, holds its own as the star in this simple and slightly spicy vegetarian supper.

5005579~The combination of pomegranates and walnuts has been used in Persian cuisine for thousands of years, as both a sauce and marinade for meats. Here it is both. The tartness of the pomegranate brings brightness and balance to the rich brisket. Be sure to marinate the brisket at least 24 hours in advance.

5005581~Key when making this batter: Be sure your beer and club soda are ice cold, and chill the batter if prepping ahead.
5005582~We liked this particular recipe with Lindt or Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate, which is around 50 percent cocoa solids. We tested the ganache with chocolate containing a higher percentage, and found the flavor too intense and the consistency less velvety.

5005584~Firm, salty Halloumi is our favorite cheese for grilling. Find it in better supermarkets and at vineandtable.com.
5005585~This is a recipe that I cook at home myself — a versatile method for having a sophisticated meal on tap with very little last-minute prep work. This is a remarkable dish because it requires nothing but a pot of simmering water to cook it successfully; there is no butter, no oil, no sautéing, and no roasting. Yet the results are delicious. Here I've stuffed the chicken with goat cheese and spinach, but you can substitute Chopped Roasted Tomatoes ( this recipe can be found in the book), or any filling you like.
5014757~This recipe was created to accompany Crown Roast of Lamb .
5005587~There are fluffy eggs, melting cheese, and golden hash browns in every bite of this one-dish meal. It makes a good stand-in for quiche, with potatoes acting as a crust.
5005588~Highly recommended!
5005589~Both easy and inexpensive, tuna-noodle casserole stretched proteins and carbohydrates to the limits and fed at least a generation of American kids very well. Canned tuna will never go away, but fresh tuna has joined it as a culinary staple, and it stars in this deconstructed version of the classic. All the elements that make tuna casserole so appealing and comforting are here, just slightly rearranged. And there’s no need to serve this on a cafeteria tray: It’s good enough for your best china.
5005590~Toss this delicious pesto with 1 1/2 pounds of your favorite pasta, or spread it on slices of Italian bread.
5005591~If you're feeling extravagant, try replacing the scallops with half a pound of lobster. Or substitute a pound of cubed chicken for the seafood and chicken broth for the clam juice.
5009683~When it comes to ice cream cakes, there are no hard-and-fast rules as to what form they can take. Some consist solely of ice cream molded and then decorated to resemble a cake, while others intersperse layers of ice cream with thin layers of cake, crisp meringue, or even crumbled cookies. Our red, white, and blue July 4th extravaganza is a gorgeous amalgam of ice cream, cake, and blueberries and raspberries cooked separately into their own jammy fillings. Frosted simply in sweetened whipped cream and topped with more berries, this cake sparkles as much as the fireworks in the sky!
5005593~Highly recommended!
5005594~If you like fried chicken with cream gravy, you'll love this sauce —sophisticated and rich, with a bit of sweet fruitiness from the Madeira. It's a wonderful alternative to traditional pan gravy. You'll have to choose between this gravy or the cider sage version for the holiday meal, as you'll need the neck and giblets as well as the pan drippings for this recipe.

It does not require fish heads, only the bones of flat fish — sole, founder, halibut, or turbot — and it doesn’t call for the extra step of sweating the bones. It has a more delicate seafood flavor, and it is not as gelatinous as the Strong Fish Stock, making it very versatile. In addition to chowder and seafood stews like bouillabaisse, you can use this to make fish velouté and delicate French sauces such as Bercy (based on velouté and shallots) or bonnefemme.</epi:recipelink></epi:recipelink>"

5013916~This recipe was created to accompany Avocado Mayonnaise .
5005617~Begin at least a day before you plan to serve the vacherins. (Don't make them on a humid day; moisture prevents meringues from drying properly and staying crisp.) Use a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter or a 3 1/2-inch round can to trace the bases.
5005618~Tabbouleh is made with bulgur, but we decided to shake things up a bit by mixing tabbouleh flavors (parsley, tomato, and lemon) with rice and lentils, a common Middle Eastern pairing. Served chilled or at room temperature, the salad is terrific with any meat, poultry, or fish. You could add chickpeas, corn, or more lentils for a vegetarian main course.
5005619~Simple to make and packed with omega-3s, this soup can be an easy weeknight supper or a sophisticated starter at a dinner party. Serve it with oyster crackers for the kids.
5005620~Tandoori chicken gets its name from the clay oven (heated by wood or coal) it is traditionally cooked in—a tandoor—which bakes meat, fish, poultry, and bread at temperatures upward of 500°F. In our version, the chicken is broiled and the signature yogurt and spice marinade contains only ingredients that are readily available on supermarket shelves.
5005621~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5005622~This is the classic country paella of Valencia, made with chicken and rabbit, and in snail season, cooked snails called vaquetas. Authentic paella should be made over firewood. Twigs from olive or orange trees are used for hot flames, and thicker logs are used for a slower fire. The trick is to have both at the same time, so that the meat and vegetables can be browned slowly, then the rice brought to the boil over the hottest part of the fire, then set over a lower flame. If you can't build a wood fire, a charcoal one will do. Valencian bachoqueta de herradura and Valencian garrofón (special green and flat green beans, respectively, from the region) were called for in the original recipe, but other green beans can be substituted, and cooked dried beans or lima beans can be substituted for the flat green beans. You can also have your butcher cut up the rabbit for you, if desired.

5005626~Beef Shank and Sausage Ragù with Whole Grain Spaghetti* As much as we love eating at old-school red-sauce joints, we're craving the updated regional Italian cuisine were seeing at restaurants across the country. In this dish, instead of marinara, we've got a rich, meaty ragù (a staple in Bologna) made with flavorful bone-in beef shanks and hot Italian sausage. Hearty whole grain pasta is the perfect vehicle for the sauce (and it's a great way to add nutritional value). The long-cooked sauce is the ideal thing to make on a lazy weekend and fills the house with delicious aromas.

5005654~"A terrific way to finish off the cranberry relish. Make full use of your oven — and your time — by roasting small red-skinned potatoes alongside the fish, then tossing the potatoes with butter and parsley to have as a side dish.

5005655~All Thai curries start with a handful of aromatic ingredients (chiles, galangal, lemongrass, turmeric, etc.) pounded into a paste with a granite mortar and pestle. The paste is then stirred into soups or stews (often with coconut milk) or used as the basis of sautéed dishes. Use a mini-processor to make the curry paste if you'd like, although this incendiary stew will take on a deeper flavor if you use a granite mortar and pestle.

5005658~These tender, flaky scones are all about the butter. And since the flavor of the butter really shines through, this is a good time to splurge on a high-quality Irish butter like Kerrygold. The extra flaky, buttery texture is achieved by using a technique borrowed from puff pastry—spreading butter onto the rolled-out dough and folding it in layers.

5005687~Healers have touted saffron's medicinal properties since the days of Hippocrates, and Cleopatra claimed that it was an aphrodisiac. Its scarcity (it takes some four thousand crocus blossoms to create an ounce of saffron) and the belief that it could be used to treat everything from wounds to the plague even caused the Austrians to go to war over the spice during the Dark Ages. This is at least one feudal folk myth that modern science has corroborated. Studies have shown that saffron has outstanding antibacterial and antiviral properties and also aids digestion. People sometimes balk at saffron's cost, but it isn't unreasonable when you consider its potency; this recipe calls for only 1/8 teaspoon, and as you'll see, a little goes a long way. This pilaf is a delightful and gorgeous dish. The rice is sautéed before cooking to avoid that sticky, gummy consistency, and ginger, parsley, and lemon zest add zing.

5015249~A basic, must-have ingredient for the serious soda crafter, ginger syrup is an excellent starter recipe. Stirred into a glass of icy seltzer, it makes a zingy, invigorating soda with just enough bite to be interesting. As a building block for more complicated drink blends, this syrup adds depth with its warm spice and clean citrus note. For a more traditional ginger syrup that will make a classic ginger ale, omit the lemon zest.
5005731~In this golden casserole (which you'll find on many Pennsylvania Dutch tables), a buttermilk custard rises to the top while the chewy, toasty corn sinks to the bottom, resulting in a two-layered pudding. The packaged sweet corn—frequently called by its most common brand name, Cope's corn—is slowly dried so that its natural sugars caramelize, a centuries-old Native American preservation method. Recipes usually call for grinding the corn, but the whole kernels impart a coarser texture that we love.

5005753~Taking a cue from German potato salad, these Yukon Golds are smashed with a hot bacon dressing and then tossed with fresh dill. Steaming rather than boiling the potatoes keeps them fluffy.

5005755~A thick layer of pure white chocolate truffle separates the amaretto-brushed layers, and a bit more truffle filling is used to flavor the whipped cream icing.
5005756~Here's a good base recipe for using frozen berries to prepare a flavorful sauce. I find that frozen berries need to cook a little to make them less watery and to concentrate their flavor. Look for raspberries that come frozen in a bag. Feel the bag to make sure all of the individual berries are loose and not clumped together. Bags of frozen berries tend to taste better than those frozen in a block.

5005780~The fruit is tossed with a peach caramel sauce (juices from the peaches combined with homemade caramel) that adds depth of flavor to the filling. Keep an eye on this pie as it bakes; it browns quickly and so needs to be tented with foil.

5005788~We like skirt steak because it's a tasty and affordable cut. Slice it thinly so it's tender.
5005789~Look for carrots and parsnips that are about two inches in diameter at their thickest point; you don't want them to be too big or too slender.

5005791~All the other kids at school will be jealous when they get a look at these delicious, colorful, healthful wraps.
5005792~This is a mostly hands-off dinner that only needs a salad of assertive greens as accompaniment. The chicken gets a head start in the oven, but then finishes up by sharing its pan with the couscous. This way, the pasta laps up flavor from the meat, while getting crispy on top, and in turn, the steam coming up from the couscous keeps the chicken incredibly juicy. An intense slurry of anchovies, garlic, and lemon makes up most of the piquant dressing, with bursts of contrasting sweetness from the raisins.
5005793~Highly recommended!
5005794~If you choose to omit the sweetbreads, simply begin the recipe by sautéing the pancetta. (In that case, you may also want to purchase a larger veal or pork loin — going up to a 5-pound veal loin or a 6-pound pork loin.)
5005795~If you’re in the mood for an Asian-inspired meal, serve this fish with the pickled cucumber and cabbage.
5005796~"Ask your butcher to remove the backbones from the racks to make carving easier. If the lamb has not been trimmed, cut off the outer layer of fat and about two inches of the fat between the bones (the bones will be exposed); this technique is called ""Frenching."" Begin preparing the lamb a day before serving to allow time for marinating."

5016024~If I could only have one dessert sauce this—without a doubt—would be it. Caramel sauce is the most complex tasting sauce I know and it goes with every flavor in the pastry kitchen: apples, nuts, berries, stone fruit, chocolate, coffee, and pineapple. It is a staple in my kitchen. I use it to dress up store-bought ice cream, serve it alongside cake, and layer it into parfaits. Frankly, no commercial caramel sauce compares to one that's homemade. There are a few good specialty ones out there, but they are expensive. Making it at home is inexpensive—sugar, water, and cream. That's it. It keeps for weeks in the fridge and can be reheated in the microwave or double boiler.
5005804~"""I spend most of late summer picking these veggies,"" Bemis says. ""I have to get creative to keep up. The pesto makes this combo so refreshing."""
5005805~Tart, raw cranberries and horseradish add plenty of zip here. Begin preparing this at least a day before serving.
5005806~This tiny meatloaf should not be overbaked! Once removed from the oven, it will keep cooking for a few minutes. The chili sauce is the American kind, not the Asian.

5005809~In Italian cooking, meat (usually breast of veal) that is flattened and then rolled around a filling is known as braciola. The recipe below applies this preparation to turkey breast - an American touch - using a distinctly Italian stuffing.

5005828~"Susan Richardson of Edina, Minnesota, writes: ""My mother worked full-time when I was growing up, so as the oldest daughter in a family of six children, I did a lot of cooking. From the time I was seven years old, my mom taught me how to cook and bake — salad, bread, vegetables, and dessert were pretty much part of every dinner. Even today, I make it a point to prepare and eat dinner with my two teenage children. Though we're very busy, we'll never abandon our dinner ritual. It's the time when we can talk and reconnect."""
5006765~To make the most of the turkey's giblets and neck, we first brown them to give the resulting stock (and later, gravy) depth of flavor.
5005830~When my Scottish stepmother married my father, in 1963, she had a lot to learn about cooking. Once she made my father what she thought was a charming American variety of onion for dinner; they turned out to be bulbs of garlic. She's come a long way since then, providing our family with increasingly exotic taste memories influenced by years of living in Mexico and Brazil. The secret to a good fool, whatever the fruit, is to taste as you go. Some need more sugar; any fruit with little acidity benefits from a smidgen of lemon or lime juice; and more delicate flavors, like mango, require less cream.
5005831~Most people think these Sicilian treats are available only in Italian bakeries. But here's delectable-and easy-proof that you can them at home. We've exchanged the usual addition of candied fruit for the more contemporary one of bittersweet chocolate and apricot preserves. Look for the cannoli shells at Italian markets.

5005849~"Enjoyed by millions in India, masala chai, a spiced, sweetened black tea mixed with milk, is now popular around the world. It is sold all over India by chai wallahs, or tea vendors, who pour the tea from big kettles into small cups. Americans have incorrectly shortened the name to chai (which means simply ""milk tea""); masala refers to the combination of spices, which often includes cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, pepper, fennel, and star anise. Although there are many chai blends available in supermarkets, making your own is quick and satisfying, and the results are much better."
5005850~This is the standard salad-relish you find in every tavern and restaurant in Istanbul. It accompanies grilled meat and especially kebabs. Turkish food is often eaten with a spoon, and so is this salad—all its ingredients are finely chopped. Instead of a simple lemon vinaigrette, which is the most common dressing, I like to add a little balsamic vinegar and lemon zest. Add as much jalapeño as you like, but bear in mind that this Turkish salsa is meant to be refreshing and not overpoweringly hot.

5005857~Highly recommended!
5005858~Forget the box of chocolates this year. Instead, make your loved one swoon with a bottle of this chocolate liqueur. Be sure to get started at least three weeks ahead so that the flavors have time to meld. Any leftover liqueur would be terrific stirred into coffee or hot chocolate.
5005859~Tart cranberries provide delicious contrast to the rich nut filling.

5005865~Pelaccio flips the kebab script by cubing luxurious cuts of steak and marinating them in coconut milk, garlic, and chiles. Try this with tri-tip, top sirloin cap steak, or rib eye; just make sure a strip of fat is still intact; you'll use it to thread onto the skewers.

5005868~A sweet-and-salty miso glaze turns tofu into little bites of comfort food, traditionally served on skewers.

5005870~In this light yet intensely flavored dish, the fish is baked, then served with a sauce rich in Asian flavors. Offer with steamed white rice, and pour white wine or Champagne.
5018039~If you think brown rice isn't for you, think again. In particular, think about brown basmati rice, whose slender grains offer an inviting combination of elegance and earthy chew. Now add in some chunks of zucchini, toasted pecans, lots of fresh herbs, and the mellowness of coriander (left over from Lamb Spice Rub ) and cumin, and you have a salad that's practically a meal.
5005872~These can be topped with caviar or smoked salmon for a special-occasion appetizer, but they are also good with fried eggs or as a side dish for grilled fish.
5005873~A plate of fresh herbs is served at most Persian meals, often taking the place of a salad. Serve this dish as an appetizer, or do as the Persians do and leave it on the table throughout the meal. Toasted spices and olive oil poured over the cheese add a warming boost of flavor.

5005895~Getting rid of the crust for this clever play on quiche Lorraine is a win-win: The cooking process is simplified, and you're left with the very best part of the quiche.
5019938~Pickled onions, the traditional condiment for chicken pibil (see chicken legs recipe further liven up what is already a flavorful dish. Although you can serve them right away, the onions turn a beautiful pink if they are made ahead (and chilled, covered, 1 day before serving).
5005897~In the early part of the decade, an appreciation of Asian flavors, a desire for spa-style cuisine, and the popularity of sushi dovetailed with the creation of this appetizer, usually prepared with raw salmon or tuna. The dish is now found on restaurant menus nationwide. This version, which calls for smoked salmon, features a wonderful combination of Pacific Rim flavors.

5005930~The use of raisins and pine nuts in lightly sweet-and-sour sauces probably came to Sicily from Turkey; these ingredients also turn up in the cooking of Venice, long a commercial gateway to Turkey and the East, but less commonly in the anchovy-and-tomato sauces that are so fundamental to the Sicilian kitchen. Note that the zucchini in this dish is cooked rather soft, in the traditional Italian manner; if you want a more contemporary crisp product, add the zucchini toward the end for a quick cooking in the thickened sauce.

The tender meat and haroseth taste wonderful splashed with the rich jus (the Sherry is a nod to Spain), but we love the extra dimension added by the bright salsa verde, too.
5005963~Parmesan goes a long way on this meatless entrée, so use sparingly. Pour some Chianti.

5005971~Earthy mushrooms, wine, and tomato bring out the best in this tender game meat. The mushrooms, with their meaty texture, round out the portion, so you get an extra-generous amount on your plate. If you can't get venison, pork tenderloin works well, too.

5005975~My aunt Martha swears that this smoky, sweet, tropical salsa takes her back to Yucatán no matter where she is when she makes it. It works especially well with Cilantro Tandoori Chicken, but it will enhance any grilled fish or meat. If the grill's fired up, throw the pineapple right on it; a grill pan will do just fine if you're cooking indoors.

5005980~Add canned white tuna (packed in water) for a delicious main course.

5015621~The following shortbread is a delicate balance of sweet and savory and makes a wonderful accompaniment to tea.
5005983~Traditional Thanksgiving flavors (squash, cinnamon, butter) are given a beautiful Persian accent. The exotic spiced butter is also a treat mixed into couscous.
5005984~Talk about convenient! Baking a whole sweet potato takes about an hour, but sautéing the grated potato takes only fifteen minutes from start to finish — and you end up concentrating the flavor to boot. This recipe dresses up your potato with Southwestern ingredients, but there's no reason not to go Asian (add ginger and soy) or Italian (add sage, brown butter, and pine nuts) as the mood strikes you. For that matter, you could swap out the sweet potato and use butternut squash instead.
5005985~Yes, avocado is high in fat, but it's the good, monounsaturated kind that helps increase satiety so you feel full with fewer calories.

5005987~Serve this entrée with crusty bread to help catch all the juices, and pour a light Italian white wine, such as Pinot Grigio. For dessert, spoon minted fresh berries atop vanilla frozen yogurt.
5005988~Watch everyone’s eyes open wide when you serve this big four-layer cake.
5005989~Consider this a reintroduction to some old standbys, because cauliflower, asparagus, and fennel taste utterly new with a mellow garlicky dressing. Food editor Kay Chun, who developed the recipe, prefers to use vegetable oil for its light, neutral flavor, which allows the garlic and the deep savor of anchovies to shine. Tossing the salad right before serving ensures that it retains its crunch.

5005993~The official vegetable of Georgia since 1990, the sweet, mild Vidalia onion is recognized worldwide for its gentle flavor. However, Vidalias can only be grown in a 20-county production area in and around Vidalia, Georgia, to legally wear the Vidalia label. Because of their thin, tender skins and relatively high sugar content, Vidalia onions are more perishable than most and need to be consumed within about one week of purchase. Look for Georgia-grown Vidalias at farmers markets around the Southeast in early spring through the summer.

5006013~Elevating the humble onion: Roasting them in their skins retains their natural sugars, and they get meltingly soft without disintegrating.

5006015~If the vibrancy of this dressing fades, perk it back up with more lime juice.
5006016~Ripe peaches can be used in place of the nectarines; choose whatever looks (and smells) best.
5006017~David Leite's neighbor, Danny Pring, insists that the goose be served with red currant jelly.

5006019~Highly recommended!
5012589~Pomegranate seeds add crunch and tang to this fennel salsa, which makes a perfect accompaniment not only to these pork chops but also to lamb.
5006021~"Babi Chin
This tender braised pork is wonderfully easy to make. The aromatic spices — cinnamon, clove, and coriander (which is toasted before grinding to deepen its taste) — add so much flavor that there's no need to brown the meat before braising it."

5006037~Round out your breakfast: Add half a small whole-grain bagel, 1 cup plain nonfat yogurt and 1/2 cup orange juice.
5006038~As in the classic recipe from Richard Olney's Simple French Food that inspired this one, two key innovations ensure a moist, incredibly succulent chicken. First, the birds are spatchcocked, meaning they're butterflied and spread flat so that both the white meat and the dark can be perfectly cooked; second, an herbed-ricotta filling is pushed under the skin, puffing slightly during cooking and extending the meat's flavor in a creamy direction. Actually, you'll notice how much we liked the filling — we call for extra to be baked in a separate dish so that everyone gets a helping. The filling becomes a cross between a popover and a soufflé in texture, with oregano and parsley supplying a suggestion of the Provençal countryside.
5006039~My friend Myriam Richard-Delorme in Paris is a great cook and she gave me this recipe. All you do is put a leg of lamb in a roasting pan with lots of cut-up tomatoes, onions, garlic, rosemary—and then pour honey over it to caramelize the lamb and tomatoes while they roast. Everything cooks in one pan and a few hours later I have the most succulent roast lamb, plus the tomatoes and pan juices become the vegetable and the sauce. OMG is it fabulous!
5006040~Steamed quinoa has an unbelievably light and fluffy texture. If you can get fresh-picked corn, you can add it to the salad raw—even without cooking, the kernels will be sweet and tender.

5019320~Highly recommended!
5017681~Every cook should have a good brisket recipe at the ready, and this one's a doozy. Braised with lots of browned onions, carrots, and celery in a mix of chicken broth and crushed tomatoes, the beef exits the oven full-flavored and fork-tender, ready to be shredded for the country hash or sliced and served with mashed potatoes for a homey dinner (though it's even better if you can wait a day). By all means, freeze the leftover braising liquid; it's wonderful as a sauce for fettuccine or as the base for a vegetable barley soup.
5006055~"Bonnie Wilkens Metully of Cincinnati, Ohio, writes: ""As much as my husband and I love to go out to eat, it's just more fun, intimate, and cozy to cook and entertain at home.

5006060~Crushed red pepper, caraway and dill accent this simple and colorful salad.

5006073~Inspired by the bright flavors of cranberry sauce, tangy cranberries and sweet orange zest add a floral tartness to this apple crisp, topped with an oatmeal cookie crumble studded with almonds. The crumble topping can be made and frozen up to 1 week ahead of time while the full crisp can be assembled and refrigerated up to 1 day before, so it can easily be baked to serve after Thanksgiving dinner.

5006092~Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills is as famous for its cooked Japanese fish dishes as it is for its stellar sushi. This scallop dish is a perfect example.
5006093~We weren't sure what would result from pouring an egg-and-yogurt mixture over a gratin of potatoes. The answer? A thin layer of tangy custard that just melts into the gratin. Like a much more sumptuous version of the sour-cream-topped baked potato, this dish is a welcome change of pace.

If you want a creamy ricotta, to serve dressed with a fruit syrup or to spread on crostini or to make cannoli cream, then you need to add some cream to the recipe: Replace 1 cup of the whole milk with heavy cream. Goat milk makes a creamier ricotta as well.

5006379~"Treat this recipe as a basic template from which to have a blast mixing and matching different meats with different cheeses. The Parmesan is a must and not an option to switch out; it's the magic ingredient that will make the meat more savory and any cheese you stuff in your slider taste cheesier.
The recipe can be halved or doubled easily, so if there are a lot of kids in your crowd, you might want to cut back on the number you make. If a bunch of your drinking buddies are on their way over, however, you'll likely want to do 1 1/2 times the recipe, or even double it.
We've given you suggestions for toppers and meat-and-cheese combinations, but those are just ideas to get your imagination going. If the weather is cooperative, fire up your grill, but if you are grill-less, the broiler does a fine job. Any which way you do it, you can't help but have fun!"

5006163~This mackerel, which pairs well with the fennel endive salad , was inspired by our trips to Southeast Asia, where dishes are commonly served with whole sprigs of fresh herbs for diners to pull off the leaves and eat as desired. Incidentally, this means less chopping for the cook. Also, to save time, we minced the ginger and garlic in a mini food processor.
5013327~This dip is our version of a Catalan sauce that has many variations and tastes great with almost any type of grilled meat or fish. It's worth the extra trouble to use hazelnuts (which need peeling), as well as almonds. Even though 2 tablespoons of hazelnuts seems a small amount, they round out the flavor of the sauce.

5006179~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5006180~I have always loved the combination of lemon and pistachios. Maybe it's the idea of yellow and green or the fact that the acidity of lemon perfectly tempers the richness of pistachios. Be careful on the second baking of these biscotti — if they get a little too dark the pistachios will turn brown and you'll lose their lovely green color.

5010453~It was a challenge for me to write a recipe for vegetable stock, because in truth, mine is different every time. I am inspired to make it whenever I am prepping lots of veggies, and I realize that what I have left over—the tops of four leeks, three parsnip stubs, carrot peels and tips, and a pile of parsley stems—is almost everything I need to make a great stock. When faced with the decision to capture these flavors so they can become the foundation for future delicious soups, stews, or beans, versus adding them to my compost pile, I try to choose the former. Once you experience how much better your recipes turn out with homemade stock (not to mention how much money you save and how many cartons you keep out of the trash), youll get more motivated. I usually keep a bag in the fridge where I save my veggie scraps, and when it gets big enough, I set my pot on the stove. The recipe below is simple and easy. You can also add corncobs, potato skins, mushroom bottoms, and even tomatoes. If you have a huge stockpot, as I do, you can easily double or triple this recipe. I keep as much stock in the refrigerator as I plan to use within 5 days and freeze the rest. —Myra

5011450~You might rub elbows with Reese Witherspoon or Molly Sims at this sushi spot on L.A.'s famed Sunset Strip. Besides raw-fish delicacies, innovative beverages are served up at the loungelike space. Hipster tipplers can sip the restaurant's Pomegranate Cocktail, which is rich in polyphenols, antioxidants that help protect your ticker.
5006224~The crust of this tart is tender and quite crumbly.
5006225~"The technique: Pureeing means to grind or mash food until smooth. Here, potatoes, parsnips, and turnips are whipped into a creamy side dish.
The payoff: A slightly sweeter, more modern take on mashed potatoes."
5006226~Parmesan isn't usually served with seafood pasta, but the cheese adds a nice richness to this linguine.
5018864~This recipe was created to accompany <a></a>Turkey with Sherry Wine Vinegar Gravy .
5006228~Tricked out with shoestring fries, this is a time-honored rendition of steak frites—meat and potatoes à la française. A rich sauce on the side enhances the already flavorful well-marbled meat.
5006229~A dash of curry powder transforms this cool fruit soup into a sweetly savory first course.

This particular recipe is a slight variation on the kugel made by my Aunt Raye, who is one of the best cooks on the planet."""

5006247~This is a super-quick stew which has its roots in Palestine. Pick your chard color here—the clean green Swiss or the sweet-shop-neon rainbow chard. It is not often that one vegetable provides such a bouquet of options. Black-eyed peas were often overlooked in my kitchen in favor of earthy black beans, buttery cannellini, or plump lima beans. No longer though; black-eyed peas are a new favorite. Sometimes, I like to top this with tahini for an extra layer of flavor.

5006249~This frozen dessert has the creamy texture of softened ice cream—but doesn't require an ice cream maker.

5017263~Highly recommended!
5006252~Highly recommended!
5006253~There's no need to introduce any liquid to the slow cooker—as the chicken legs and vegetables cook, they release their juices to make a very savory stew. Whisking in some sour cream just before serving adds body to the sauce, and fresh cilantro brings brightness to this no–hassle one–dish dinner. Poblano chiles have notoriously tough skins, but we were happily surprised to learn that several hours of gentle cooking makes the skins practically melt away.
5006254~More and more people are cooking with ground buffalo meat because it's lower in fat than beef chuck. That very asset can turn into a liability if the meat is cooked too long, so here, sautéed chopped portobello mushrooms contribute additional moistness and flavor. Don't reach for the ketchup: A crisp slaw of celery and apples in a mustardy dressing is a piquant surprise.
5006255~Highly recommended!
5006256~Cooking by color might not be the surest way to devise holiday-appropriate recipes, but who can resist the lure of black linguine on Halloween? Tossing it with pumpkin-hued vegetables lusty with garlic and hot pepper might seem like hobgoblin overkill, except that the flavors work well together. Really well. So much so that you'll be making this pasta combination again and again, long after the jack-o-lanterns have disappeared.

5009404~"When the opportunity arises—as it did with this salmon—we can't resist a little trompe l'oeil, a chance to have some harmless fun with our food, because, well, food is fun. And with Hanukkah being a particularly kid-friendly holiday, we know children and adults alike will get a big kick out of the edible potato ""scales"" that top these individual slabs of salmon. Your budding young chefs will love arranging the scales on the fish."

5006272~This garlicky sauce is the traditional accompaniment to the starchy root vegetables of the Hispanic Caribbean, especially Cuba. The acidic medium is usually Seville, or bitter, orange juice, though lime juice or white vinegar can be substituted. The mojo is at its best spooned or brushed over piping-hot boiled yuca, plantains, or other starchy tropical vegetables.
5006273~Sardinia, Italy
5006274~Sicilian cooking is hot right now, so we've taken some of its classic, assertive ingredients and put them into a hearty stuffing. It's something new for the turkey.

5006278~"A perfect accent for an outdoor supper during tomato season. In winter, it revives the palate as an aperitif.
This drink demonstrates so ably how fresh ingredients can be incorporated into everyday drinking cocktails. Head to your kitchen garden or snag a big bunch of basil at the farmers’ market, and you’re mere steps from a living drink that will make your head dizzy. This drink smashes basil, but you can smash anything—tarragon, thyme, cilantro, or kefir lime leaves. Let this drink inspire you. We like to host a garden party with an assortment of fresh herbs and gins, and let friends muddle their way through an array of flavors."
5006279~Highly recommended!
5006280~I first tasted a majoon at the Café Glacé in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, where these decadent concoctions are whipped up with vanilla ice cream for Westwood's large Persian community. I make majoon with yogurt instead, which gives it a hint of lemony sourness and packs enough nutrients for a healthy breakfast. Although it takes more time, I recommend toasting nuts and seeds in the oven on a dry baking sheet, rather than in a pan on the stove top, because they cook more evenly. You can toast a few cups at a time and keep them on hand for various recipes. Toast the delicate coconut flakes, sesame seeds, and pistachios at 300°F for 3 to 4 minutes, then transfer immediately to a plate to prevent burning. Toast the almonds and walnuts at 350°F for about 12 minutes, until fragrant and crisp.
5006281~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5006283~Try a heritage Berkshire pork loin rack for great flavor and tenderness. If you are lucky enough to have a pork vendor at your local farmers market you can buy it there (you might want to order it in advance) or it can be mail ordered from www.heritagepork.com or prairiepridefarmminnesota.foodoro.com. Many butchers can cut a loin rack for you as well. Commercially, the loin rack is cut into pork chops but if you call ahead they can cut a roast for you.

5007802~Highly recommended!
5006293~Roasting greens, such as broccoli rabe, turns them deliciously crispy and earthy. The broccoli rabe's inherent bitterness nicely offsets the sweetness of the roasted-garlic pan sauce. The chicken needs to be salted one day ahead.
5006294~This salad is a wonderful mix of flavors and textures. Serve it with warm flatbread, such as naan. Make a simply beautiful dessert by tossing together chopped honeydew, cantaloupe, and watermelon.
5006295~Don't rush the browning of the onions—it's essential to the finished soup's flavor.

5006310~The lamb needs to marinate for a least eight hours, so start the recipe ahead of time. This menu is nice with light red wine, like Beaujolais. Purchase your favorite cookies and some top-notch ice cream to make home-made ice cream sandwiches; it's as easy as placing a scoop of ice cream onto a cookie and topping it with another cookie. Freeze the sandwiches until you're ready to indulge.

5006332~Many people consider stuffing the best part of a Thanksgiving meal, and they can be quite particular about it — some like it dense and moist from the turkey juices, others fluffy and browned from the oven. We've made sure everyone will be satisfied: This recipe makes enough stuffing for the turkey and the onions, with plenty left over for another baking dish of stuffing.

5006335~Often thought of as savory ingredients, pine nuts and rosemary make an exciting, unexpected pairing in sweets. This play on a classic Tuscan dessert makes a nice ending to a fall or wintertime meal, be it simple or fancy. The fragrant, lightly sweetened whipped cream and the caramel tones of the filling seem to magically warm up a chilly day. You can candy a sprig of rosemary for a pretty garnish, if you like, or leave it fresh.
5006336~This drool-worthy dessert is a chocoholics dream come true. There are 2 grams of fiber per serving…from the cocoa! Swap candied orange for the ginger to dial down the spiciness.

5006342~Chef Todd Aarons of Tierra Sur at Herzog Wine Cellars in Oxnard, California, shared this recipe as part of a Hanukkah cocktail party menu he created exclusively for Epicurious. These potato and Jerusalem artichoke latkes fry up quickly and are best served immediately, but if necessary, they can be held briefly in a warm oven. If you can't find Jerusalem artichokes—also known as sunchokes—Aarons recommends substituting parsnips or celery root.
5006343~Two elements make this dish special. Usually the smaller shanks are braised, but a whole leg works just as well and looks more impressive. Also, white wine is used for the braising instead of red. What to drink: A full-bodied Zinfandel.
5006344~Highly recommended!
5006345~For chewy texture, undercook the biscotti slightly in the second baking.
5006346~Earthy mushrooms are the base for a soup that also benefits from the saltwater essence of plump oysters.

5017867~Don't say we didn't warn you! These hors d'oeuvresize soft tacos will be gobbled up faster than you can say tinga de pollo. But no need to fear, because the recipe is easily doubled, which means you'll be tasting and toasting until the clock strikes midnight.
5006349~In Italy, thin slices of bresaola are typically served as an antipasto. In this recipe, the thinly sliced meat is topped with a crunchy brussels sprout salad.

5006375~"Everything I know about getting a party started right, I learned at Houston's restaurant in Atlanta. No kidding. Its creamy, bubbling spinach and artichoke dip was a must on date night in high school, and these days it's the dish that even the snobbiest of food snobs can't resist. I'll whip it up for friends and, no matter what else I serve, it's always the first thing to go. Sometimes I leave out the spinach, add red pepper flakes, or use whatever vegetable is in season. In other words, it stands up to improvisation. We've put a spring spin on the dish, starring asparagus, just-dug-up leeks, sweet peas, and fresh goat cheese. Serve it with crostini, tortilla chips, or crudités. Or just eat it by the spoonful. It's that good.

5006379~"Treat this recipe as a basic template from which to have a blast mixing and matching different meats with different cheeses. The Parmesan is a must and not an option to switch out; it's the magic ingredient that will make the meat more savory and any cheese you stuff in your slider taste cheesier.
The recipe can be halved or doubled easily, so if there are a lot of kids in your crowd, you might want to cut back on the number you make. If a bunch of your drinking buddies are on their way over, however, you'll likely want to do 1 1/2 times the recipe, or even double it.
We've given you suggestions for toppers and meat-and-cheese combinations, but those are just ideas to get your imagination going. If the weather is cooperative, fire up your grill, but if you are grill-less, the broiler does a fine job. Any which way you do it, you can't help but have fun!"

5006444~(Soupe au Pistou)
5006445~Soft, creamy risotto topped with warm roasted vegetables makes a complete meal in a bowl. If you don't like the idea of standing at the stove and stirring risotto to a perfect consistency, this is the method for you. Thirty minutes in the oven and this risotto comes out cooked to perfection while you and your beloved wind down from your day.

5006450~Don't be put off by this recipe if you don't like the slippery texture of okra — it disappears when the okra is coated in batter.
5006451~Highly recommended!
5006452~The pesto is also great on portobello mushroom burgers, chicken burgers, and turkey burgers.
5006453~This rich, subtly tangy cream spiked with almond essence gives ripe, sliced pears just the embellishment they need to go from fruit to fabulous.
5006454~This chai is a knockout on its own, but gin adds subtle flavors that complement the chai's complexity. (Needless to say, since Kashmir is predominantly Muslim, alcohol would not be added there.) Nuts in a cocktail seemed a little odd at first, and it's fine to strain them out before serving, but most of us found them addictive.
5006455~Lowcountry cooking is full of ideas that seem foreign to outsiders. This sweet and spicy chutney is the perfect foil for salty country ham. Ground together, the two form a paste for memorable appetizers.

5006463~A satisfying meatless main course.
5006464~It's so straightforward to put everything under the broiler at once and remove each component as finished—when the bread is toasted, the romaine is wilted, the chicken is cooked, and the tomato is juicy.
5006465~Highly recommended!
5018042~Serve this Greek salad as a crisp first course, or pair it with grilled pita bread and you have lunch for two.
5016704~Though these bruschetta are a terrific first course for almost any meal. They'd actually make a great lunch as well—just think of them as open-faced sandwiches.
5006468~In this perfect no-cook dish you can substitute crumbled bacon for the chicken or just omit the meat altogether.
5006469~Get your pan nice and hot. If you have a cast-iron skillet, now's the time to use it.
5006470~Serve this with the Raspberry-Apricot Compote With Champagne and Lemon Verbena.
5006471~Highly recommended!
5006472~Thanksgiving is hands-down my favorite holiday. Bar Americain is open each year for Thanksgiving, and we typically serve about six hundred people before the day is over. No matter how many wonderful selections we offer on the abbreviated holiday menu, without fail turkey is the biggest seller—partly because people love it and partly, I think, out of a sense of tradition. This is the turkey that I serve at Bar Americain, with only the dressing and sides changing from year to year. This year I am pairing the all-American bird with all-American ingredients: wild mushrooms and Pinot Noir from the Pacific Northwest, figs from California, cranberries from Maine, bacon from Kentucky, and sweet potatoes from Georgia.
5006473~Barbecue sauces flavored with soft drinks are a long-standing tradition in the South.
5006474~Start off a holiday meal in the freshest way possible: With crunchy radishes dipped in olive oil and then into flavorful herbed salt.
5006475~Highly recommended!

5006478~Tzatziki is a popular Greek sauce made from yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, and dill. Here we've subbed in shallots for garlic and used it to top skewers of shrimp. Serve any leftovers with pita chips, as a substitute for mayo on roast chicken sandwiches, or as a sauce for grilled lamb.
5006479~Highly recommended!
5010470~You'll use some of the dressing for the grilled chicken and the rest for the noodle salad .
5006481~"Brandi Neuwirth of Cary, North Carolina, writes: ""My family and I moved here from Los Angeles last year, and my new surroundings have really influenced my cooking. There's a great farmers' market nearby where I get lots of local ingredients. The produce there inspired me to create this dish, which is a real taste of the South."""
5006482~To read of my travels, you might get the impression that for most of the last three years, I've done nothing but prowl night markets and food stalls. True, a lot of great grilling takes place on Third World street corners, but you can also find some pretty amazing barbecue at luxury resorts. One such place is Amandari, a hotel built right into a rice paddy near the artist town of Ubud, Bali. Dinner began with a Balinese welcome dance performed by local children in gold-embroidered gowns. My wife, Barbara, and I dined at a table for two strewn with rose petals in an open pavilion facing a lily pond. A team of chefs cooked for us and us alone on portable grills over charcoal. The succession of dishes—grilled shrimp with fiery lemongrass sambal, Balinese grilled chicken, and whole grilled fish with kaffir lime leaves—revealed Balinese cooking in all its polymorphic glory. A profoundly complex cuisine only hinted at in the food at your typical street-corner stall.
5006483~Similar to the whipped feta spread at Papagus Greek Taverna in Chicago.
5006484~For a few years now I've been a judge at the Whirlpool Accubake Unique Cake Contest, which is similar to the Pillsbury Bake-Off. A chocolate cake with a pecan and butterscotch toffee topping called Chocolate Coffee Toffee Cake by Elizabeth Kirsch from Pennsylvania won first place in 2002 and the $10,000 prize, which she donated to Heifer International. Elizabeth told me she made her cakes in glass canning jars and would tuck one into her husband's business trip luggage so he wouldn't miss his favorite cake while he was out of town. This simplified version of her cake would be perfect to take to a picnic or even a backyard barbecue

5006490~What to drink: Hard cider, served in your prettiest Champagne flutes.
5006491~Highly recommended!
5006492~Big and beefy, this luscious cut of meat definitely has a celebratory presence. Here it partners with porcini mushrooms, which are both rubbed on the roast and incorporated into the sauce. For the best flavor, look for well-marbled meat.
5006493~This version of pasta e ceci (pasta with chickpeas) thickens the sauce with puréed chickpeas, and it's finished with a fresh garlic-and-rosemary oil, which adds great flavor and an even better aroma.
5006494~Highly recommended!
5006495~Highly recommended!
5006496~A vegetarian twist on a Chinese take-out standard, these sprouts deliver crunch, spice, and zing.
5017579~These delightful cupcakes are great as soon as they've cooled, but their carrot-cake moistness and hint of spice really come through the day after they're baked.
5006498~This rich, custard-like stuffing is also a great main-course option for vegetarians at the Thanksgiving table; it would be nice with a salad for brunch or lunch, too.
5006499~These dim sum–style shrimp toasts make a surprisingly simple—and utterly addictive—at-home snack. With this method, you don’t even need a deep fryer to pull them off.
5006500~Canned beans get an upgrade thanks to garlic and spices.

5006511~A mini-processor comes in handy for making the pesto.
5006512~Currants, roasted peppers, chick-peas, olives, green onions and cilantro add color and flavor to this portable salad. To start, dip wedges of pita bread into store-bought hummus (a creamy puree of chick-peas and sesame paste, available at Middle Eastern markets). A slightly chilled Beaujolais or lemonade is a refreshing beverage choice.
5006513~This is a spicy, vinegary paste from the beautiful region of Goa. It is great with meat, chicken and fish; I have used it in a few recipes to get you started. Just remember when you cook with it, it is all raw so it does need to be well cooked before you use it.
5006514~How does this remain shatteringly crisp? The secret is hiding in the batter: potato starch and arepa flour, the tickets to everlasting crunchiness.
5006515~We've given eminently tasty salmon the crab-cake treatment. Topping the lovely, golden (and satisfyingly chunky) cakes is a tart, tangy yogurt sauce rather than the usual tartar.
5006516~Double the chile oil, keep it chilled, and drizzle it over flatbreads, pastas, and all of your grilled meats and vegetables all summer long.
5006517~Briefly cooking the tomatoes is key–the finished sauce should still be very fresh-tasting.
5006518~Serve with: Grilled portobello mushrooms and a rice salad with sliced radishes. Dessert: Scoops of coconut, pineapple, and passion-fruit sorbets drizzled with rum.
5006519~Batter-fried fish tacos as we know them in the United States originated in the 1930s in Ensenada, Mexico, home to a large Japanese immigrant population who worked in the fishing industry there. Along with their skills as fishermen, the Japanese also brought with them the technique for tempura—deep-frying fish in batter. The Mexicans adapted this technique to make tacos, using young shark, a very inexpensive local catch that held up beautifully when fried. These tacos are best served immediately as fried foods get soggy if left to sit. If you can’t find shark, substitute a firm, moist white fish like opah, tilapia, or mahi mahi.
5006520~We can always count on Clint Cantwell to come up with flavor profiles that, at first glance, make us blink like we just got smoke in our eyes. Here he's done it again by rubbing steak with coffee, paprika, and coriander—some of the hottest seasonings out there now. It opens up some new flavors you might not have thought of, but they work!

5006531~Chinese egg noodles are at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.
5006532~Roasting grapes is fun and unexpected, although very popular in the wine regions of Italy. I remember being surprised to find juicy grapes cooked into a dense olive oil cake in Tuscany years ago. Here the sweetness of the grapes balances the earthy truffle oil and rosemary, and the feta adds a salty kick. The flavors are just perfect, and this flatbread takes me right back to Tuscany every time.
5006533~You won't be sorry with tequila, grapefruit, and Campari.

Owner Corbin Douglass is known for fulfilling all sorts of requests, from ensuring that guests are seated at their favorite table in front of the fireplace to presenting an engagement ring on the dessert cart. Chef Duy Pham changes the contemporary French menu seasonally. The following dish was inspired by roast Peking duck, a Sunday tradition in Pham's family."

5006539~You can shred the potatoes, onions, and celery root in a food processor with the shredding disk. However, you'll need to use 5 eggs (instead of 4) because the machine grates more coarsely and the mixture will require more binding.
5006540~Highly recommended!
5017811~"Pennsylvania is now a national center for cultivated exotic or ""specialty"" mushrooms like shiitake and crimini, but early colonists found plenty of familiar wild mushrooms growing free for the picking in the forests of their new world.

5006550~"In our never-ending quest for the best burger, we think we've hit on an outstanding version that requires nothing more than a trip to the supermarket and a short sojourn in the freezer for the bacon. Sure, there are those DIY purists who are going to buy several different beef cuts from a high-end butcherif not butcher the beef themselves from their own grass-fed steerthen coarsely grind it with their own sterilized meat grinder, but most of us just want an easy recipe for a really great backyard burger.
Burger-meisters might be shocked, but this burger does best by being cooked a bit more slowly, over indirect heat. So sit back, pop open a cold one, and let these burgers baste themselves into a sublime place."
5006551~When you brush the bottom pie crust with an egg wash, you keep the fruit from making the pie soggy as it bakes. By sprinkling the top crust with sugar, it makes for a great sugary crust.

5006556~This risotto has the classic creamy yet al dente texture and features a combination of Parmesan cheese and seafood. Contrary to popular belief, Italians do partner cheese with seafood in some dishes; we recommend it here without reservation.
5006557~This pasta celebrates the month of September, when tomatoes are truly in full season and just exploding. It's our favorite take on pasta al pomodoro.

5006561~These irresistible nuggets, a specialty of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, are here made with boneless chicken instead of the usual chicken-on-the-bone.
5006562~Four Horsemen’s glorious take on patatas bravas requires cooking the potatoes three times (once blanched, twice fried). We wouldn’t make you go through all that if it wasn’t worth it.
5006563~Beef with broccoli, the popular Chinese restaurant dish, is even better with the addition of sweet yam.
5006564~Feel free to create your own mesclun mix. We suggest baby red oakleaf, baby arugula, mâche, and bite-size pieces of Belgian endive, frisée, and radicchio.
5006565~Because the crème fraîche melts into the potatoes, this dish has the virtue of tasting lush without appearing overly so. For an even more sumptuous look, give the salad a generous dollop on top.

5006596~Cooking the potatoes in vinegar seasons them from within, and a final drizzle boosts the flavor.
5006597~Homey and comforting, this lovely pie comes together without much fuss. Thin egg noodles are layered with ham, cheese, and mushrooms; tiny peas scattered between the layers add a green burst of flavor. The dish is baked until beautifully golden, sliced like pie, and eaten at room temperature. This is traditionally baked on the day before Easter, to be eaten as part of the family picnics enjoyed on Angel's Monday, Italy's national holiday the day after Easter.

Bringing shoyu ramen home takes a trip to an Asian market, three days of work, and your largest pot, but this low-stress (really!) labor of love might be the best soup you'll ever make.

5006616~The flavor of this pasta fagioli is so haunting and the texture so voluptuous that you'll wonder how such modest ingredients could conspire to create something so indulgent. And what makes it successful as a make-ahead main is that the pasta is cooked separately. I make vats of the bean soup ahead, then each time I reheat a portion, I boil up a fresh batch of dried pasta so the al dente texture balances the creaminess of the soup.
5006617~Shredded iceberg lettuce topped with ranch dressing is the perfect side dish. End with scoops of lime sorbet drizzled with tequila and sprinkled with lime peel. Canned chipotle chilies are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

5006624~I love Jim Lahey's crust because it's thin, crispy, and so very reliable. I can't ever remember a night where it didn't work. When we're feeling healthy, we replace the white flour with whole wheat flour-if you want to be sneaky about it with the kids, you can start by just replacing half with whole wheat flour. We usually use one ball of dough for one dinner and then freeze the extra for another dinner later. To thaw, remove from freezer about two to three hours before using and work it with your hands if it's still stiff.

5006634~The batter for these fritter-like cakes is pretty dry, but that's what yields crisp results. Pressing them flat in the pan also helps maximize the crunch factor.

5017582~Salsa di Pomodoro
5006637~Braising pork shoulder produces a fall-apart tender roast. And when milk is the braising liquid, what results is a sauce that is reminiscent of flavorfully infused ricotta.
5006638~Aromatic sprigs of rosemary smooth out vodka-spiked lemonade, providing a bracing counterpoint to the lusty flavors of the many antipasti dishes. It's a great addition to anyone's cocktail canon. To make a kid-friendly quaff, simply omit the vodka.

If your orange flower water is from the Middle East (most often Lebanon) you will need to use more to taste; the Middle Eastern-style is not as strongly flavored as the French version. I also use Athens brand phyllo (it says ""fillo"" on the box), which comes in a 1-pound container with two separate packages inside. Make sure to use unsalted pistachios. This baklava is actually not at all difficult to make, but take care not to press down on the layers of pastry as you layer and then cut them."
5006655~Affordable leg of lamb is a great way to break out of the usual beef-chicken-pork rut, especially when used in a quick-cooking but complex-tasting dish like this.
5006656~Our bo ssäm was a long time in the making before it showed up on the menu. I'd had an inkling for years it would be a good idea—bo ssäm is a supercommon dish in Korean restaurants, though the ingredients and cooking that go into it are frequently an afterthought. The oysters are usually Gulf oysters from a bucket, the kind that are really only suited to frying; the pork is belly that's been boiled into submission. Almost every time I ate it at a restaurant, I'd think about how much better it would be if all the ingredients were awesome.
5006657~We tested this pie recipe with canned sweet potatoes, but it just wasn’t as good. Go fresh or go home.
5006658~Pierogies are large dumplings filled with meat, cheese or vegetables, and they are very popular in Poland. A precooked version is available frozen in many supermarkets.

5019435~A must for fajitas! Make it smooth or chunky. For the best results, be sure the avocados are ripe.
5006668~Naomi Pomeroy, chef/owner of Beast and Expatriate in Portland, Oregon, shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. Filled with leftover turkey, mashed potatoes, and peas or green beans, these samosas are a Thanksgiving-themed take on a dish from Pomeroy's newest restaurant, Expatriate. At the restaurant, Pomeroy serves the samosas over a cabbage and herb salad, and drizzled with tamarind brown butter dressing, but the samosas are so flavorful, we like them on their own. If you want to include a dipping sauce or two, Pomeroy recommends this Cilantro-Mint Chutney and/or purchased mango chutney. Of course, you can always serve them on a bed of greens.
5006669~The spirit of Japan comes through in this dish: It is lovely to behold and has a delicate, light quality, yet the extraordinary flavors will seize your attention with the culinary equivalent of surround sound.

5006675~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019424~This fantastic dessert is perfect for the cool months of late fall and winter. Cubes of tender pumpkin bread are baked in a rich custard laced with bourbon and maple syrup. Crisp apple cider is the base of a buttery caramel sauce spiced with fresh ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and star anise. Forget about serving the same-old pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving and put this out instead for a new twist on two old classics. The recipe includes directions for making your own pumpkin bread to use in the pudding, but you can of course also use a loaf of pumpkin bread from your favorite bakery. Brioche or cinnamon-raisin bread would also work perfectly.
5006677~Highly recommended!
5006678~This soup is a terrific choice for those over sixty, as it's abundant in nutrients one especially needs later in life. These include healthy plant protein (older adults are prone to protein insufficiency), fiber, vitamin K, potassium, lysine to aid in calcium absorption, and folate to help reduce homocysteine levels, which are a major risk factor for heart disease. And of course, all soups are soft and so are a favorite for anyone with dental difficulties.

5006688~Take these olives along on your next picnic.
5018017~As befitting a diner dessert, this ice cream is thick and rich and perfectly accents the apple tartlet. Cinnamon ice cream generally falls into three categories: infused via cinnamon sticks during the milk warming; ground cinnamon added during the milk warming; and ground cinnamon added at the very end. You can't get a real cinnamony flavor from the sticks alone, and adding ground cinnamon too early makes for a very strange texture. The third option lends a nice flavor and texture and leaves the custard pleasantly speckled.
5006690~They pack almost all your daily vitamin C.

5006709~In France, this soup would be prepared with a baking pumpkin. A mixture of butternut and acorn squashes mimics the French pumpkin's exceptional taste and texture. Pour a lightly chilled rosé with this colorful first course. Either a Rhône Tavel or a Provençal Bandol would be lovely.
5006710~Highly recommended!
5006711~We decided to use sweetened flaked coconut rather than fresh coconut for this recipe because it not only saves time but enhances the overall flavor of the dish, adding a touch of subtle sweetness. Soaking the basmati rice strengthens the grains to prevent the rice from breaking down during cooking.
5006712~Mushrooms made from meringue are the traditional edible decoration for a Yule log cake, and their cute quotient is high—they never fail to charm young and old alike. Saying they're edible is like calling a chocolate truffle edible; if you love crisp meringue, you'll adore the crunchy, airy contrast the mushrooms provide for our creamy Tiramisu Yule Log cake. Classically they're made from a white meringue, but we couldn't resist coloring ours with a little added cocoa to make the mushrooms look like cremini or baby bellas.

5006720~Thinly sliced beets (not beef) lay the foundation for this vibrant rendition of the Italian appetizer. Use any assortment of small beets — red, golden, purple, or candy-striped. A local farmers' market will have the best selection. The beets can be roasted and peeled one day before serving.
5006721~Highly recommended!
5006722~The secret to this flavorful sauce, which is delicious with almost all grilled meat and fish, is to use any herb that looks good at the market. Just be sure to include parsley: It gives the salsa backbone.
5006723~The parfaits can be made a day ahead.
5006724~The deconstructed caprese is a sandwich on a skewer, featuring crusty bread, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and basil. While it looks sort of fussy, its actually a snap to pull together and it has a colorful presentation that looks quite smashing in a lunch box. Small mozzarella balls, also known as bocconcini, measure about an inch across and are sold in the specialty cheese section of many supermarkets. Pack the skewers with a little side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for lunchtime dipping. For bigger appetites, increase the recipe by 50 percent, which will make three skewers instead of two.

5006751~This is best eaten the day it's made — left to sit longer, the cake can get a bit soggy from the fruit.
5006752~This stunning sweet from Spago Beverly Hills can be assembled ahead of time, then baked at the last minute. Note that the dessert needs to be frozen at various points, so plan accordingly. When preparing the meringue disks, use a six-ounce tuna fish can as a template.
5006753~"Figs are abundant in Jerusalem and many trees, bearing the most delectable fruit, actually belong to no one, so anybody can help themselves. Summer months are always tinted with the smell of wild herbs and ripe figs. The mother of Sami's childhood neighbor and friend, Jabbar, used her roof to dry the glut of figs (and tomatoes) in the hot summer sun, spending hours cleaning and sorting them meticulously. Poor Um Jabbar Sami and her son never wasted time and used to sneak up to her roof regularly, stealing her figs at their peak and causing havoc. This wasn't enough for Jabbar, though. The boy had such a sweet tooth that he always carried around with him an old match box full of sugar cubes, just in case. Unfortunately, this habit had clear ramifications, evident in his ""charming"" smile."

5006762~"When food editor Shelley Wiseman was asked to develop a recipe for an over-the-top turkey, she began by rubbing truffle butter under its skin. ""Its a cheap shot,"" she admitted, ""but its damn delicious."" We all agreed—its the best turkey most of us have ever tasted. The butter, an excellent carrier of that unmistakable truffle flavor, moistens the turkeys meat and crisps its skin during a high-heat roast. For this splendid centerpiece, a nuanced French shallot-wine sauce is just the thing."
5006763~Smoked sable is as moist as smoked salmon, but with a voluptuous silkiness all its own. To balance its sea-saltiness, top it with earthy roasted beets and fresh watercress. This festive salad makes a wonderfully light start to a lavish Thanksgiving feast.
5015424~With just a touch of sugar, this tender crust cradles the pastry cream and glazed-pear filling especially well.
5006765~To make the most of the turkey's giblets and neck, we first brown them to give the resulting stock (and later, gravy) depth of flavor.

5006776~Matt Wallace, bartender at Harvard & Stone in Los Angeles, created this potent fruit-filled punch for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. The combination of pineapple, orange, and lemon plus the crisp, dry bubbles from the Champagne really wake up your palate after a long winter, he says. The citrus and sugar base is called oleo-saccharum, and is common in older punch recipes. Wallace says it's an excellent way to add a subtle citrusy perfume to the final drink, and requires time but very little labor.
5006777~For extra eye appeal, use tricolor pasta in this fresh-from-the-garden salad.

Sturdy parsley is also easier to find year-round (and more affordable) than basil. Use this sauce as you would any pesto: spooned over grilled vegetables, spread on a sandwich, and, yes, swirled into pasta. Bonus: Parsley pesto holds its vibrant color much longer than the other stuff.

5006833~The buttermilk in this soup gives it a light, tangy richness that harmonizes with the sweetness of the peas and the gentle bite of the curry. Though it looks lovely in a bowl, serve this soup in drinking glasses, to be sipped rather than spooned, for a nice change of pace.
5006834~Ana Sortun, chef-owner of Oleana in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is known for her modern interpretation of Middle Eastern and Turkish cuisine. When it comes to chicken breasts, she seeks out local, organic birds and chooses a flavorful spice rub. One of her favorite seasonings is baharat, a Middle Eastern spice mixture that includes cumin, oregano, and dried mint. Here, she pairs chicken skewers with a cooling yogurt sauce and a colorful pomegranate and pistachio relish.
5006835~A stylish dinner party dish with a bonus: Much of the prep work can be done a day ahead. At the store, have the butcher bone and trim all of the fat and membrane from a 4 3/4-pound center-cut veal rib roast, resulting in a 3-pound oblong boneless veal loin.
5006836~Maru is the name of the adorable Japanese cat whose love of jumping into and out of boxes has inspired us to waste many happy hours drinking beer in front of our computer when we should have been working instead. This cocktail has the popular Japanese lager Sapporo as its base, a crisp and well-carbonated brew that is typically paired with sushi. Here, the slight bitterness of the beer is tempered by tart berries and mandarin oranges.
5014685~Highly recommended!
5006838~This pesto if very simple, and its mild, herbaceous flavor makes it the ideal companion for just about any of the meatballs. While many pesto recipes call for pine nuts, we prefer the flavor (and lower price) of walnuts. Try finely chopping them and adding them right at the end for a nice, crunchy texture. We also love this as a healthy party dip, especially because it has no raw garlic—your guests will thank you too! Just cut up some carrots, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, and celery and you're ready to go. You can swap arugula for spinach if you prefer. Pesto freezes well and will keep for up to three months in the freezer.

5006874~I grew up on green beans thoren, and while I'll never tire of its crunchy deliciousness, I think adding corn makes it even better. And even though people don't often associate stir-fries with Indian cooking, this dish is a favorite in Kerala. It's a combination of diced vegetables and coconut, but the key is moistening the coconut so it can soak up the ground spices first. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.
5006875~The trick to this gorgeous dessert is to use imported white chocolate and to melt it carefully, since white chocolate is extremely heat sensitive. Let the terrine mixture get only warm enough to melt the white chocolate and butter.

5007034~This recipe was created to accompany Seared Rosemary Scallops .
5006880~What to drink: A red Rhône wine like Châteauneuf-du-Pape or Gigondas, with bold fruit flavors and earthy notes.
5006881~With some warm corn bread, this chili is a meal in itself. You wouldn't know there was chocolate in the recipe, but it adds a subtle depth of flavor to the dish.
5010971~Here's a unique no-cabbage slaw with a dressing that is spicy and a little sweet.
5006883~Offer with your favorite tossed green salad and some crusty bread.
5006884~Who doesn't love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter? These eggs are like an upscale version of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. You can actually make them in any mold you like, but I generally make them egg-shaped. To do it my way, you will need plastic or polycarbonate egg molds (see tips, below) to make perfectly shaped ovals. They are avilable in various sizes at most candy- and cake-supply stores. Make sure that they are very clean and dry before using, or the chocolate will stick.
5006885~A salad topping.
5006886~Fragrant, herbaceous chermoula sauce acts as both a marinade and a dressing for this pretty, Moroccan-inspired salad of carrot ribbons, crisp cucumbers, tangy feta, and bright pomegranate seeds.

5015279~What's wonderful about challah is that it can be used in so many ways: to sanctify the Sabbath, of course, but just as important, to make French toast, grilled cheese, and croutons and as breading in meatballs. Maybe not the way God intended it, but I'm sure She understands. Israel is the land of milk and honey, and this challah has both. For those of you who want to stay away from milk, it's fine to substitute water.

5006897~Saffron rice is an indispensable accompaniment in Persian cuisine, and it tastes just as good made with fluffy quinoa. Crushing and steeping the saffron in hot water brings out its full flavor and color. If you have coconut oil on hand, the naturally sweet flavor pairs nicely with the cherries and almonds.
5006898~Active time: 35 min Start to finish: 35 min
5006899~Substituting cooked chicken for the lobster also yields excellent results.
5006900~Here's an easy-to-make sauce for shrimp or crab claws. It's also good prepared with fresh dill or thyme instead of tarragon.
5006901~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5006902~Garlic bread is perfect on the side. You can find Creole or Cajun seasoning in the spice section of most supermarkets.
5006903~A rustic tart with a delicious hazelnut crust, sweet filling and buttery topping.
5008595~The bread is terrific on its own, too.
5006905~Sweet and salty, the ham is great served with roasted potatoes and applesauce.
5006906~Mini pound cakes are not only delicious but a perfect dessert for picnics or box lunches. For a more formal look, pur e some blueberries with a little sugar and serve the sauce over the cakes.
5006907~Highly recommended!
5006908~Be sure to buy four extra cups of spinach if you plan to make the frittata.
5008481~A western twist on the old-fashioned pecan pie . California walnuts, dates and brandy give this pie its candy-bar flavor.
5006910~A spice combination that is inspired by Indian cuisine enhances this sensational soup. Riesling or Sauvignon Blanc as a refreshing partner.
5006911~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Diane Kochilas's book Meze: Small Plates to Savor and Share from the Mediterranean Table. Kochilas also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.

5006928~"In Mexico, this breakfast dish is called huevos ahogados, meaning ""drowned eggs,"" since the eggs are served in soup bowls with a lot of sauce."
5007809~This spiced-up Asian-inspired sauce is perfect for dipping French fries or crudité, or for drizzling over seared chicken or fish.
5006930~This is the breakfast Sam and I probably eat most often regardless of the season. In truth, it's usually a dish we whip up as a late breakfast on weekdays when we're both working from home and most emails have been returned. It's wonderfully versatile and allows you to use up any leftover grains you have from previous meals, folding in leafy greens for a bit of color. In that sense, think of it more as a template rather than a hard-and-fast approach. Any leafy greens and most grains will work, although I veer away from small, delicate grains like amaranth because they can get lost in the dish.
5006931~The technique for cooking vegetables in water, oil, and vinegar is called à la Grecque, or Greek style. Fennel, celery, pearl onions, and feta cheese round out the salad. Serve a full-boded Chardonnay with it
5006932~Highly recommended!
5006933~Wild rice has an affinity for fish, and we think it's particularly good alongside tender pieces of smoked salmon. Crisp snow peas and wedges of hard-boiled egg round out the salad, and a refreshing dill vinaigrette brings all the flavors together.

Having grown up watching my mother cook for our large family, I used her recipes. She was always trying new dishes whenever we had guests and sharing her adventurous attitude toward eating. These days, even though my wife and I both work, we still cook several times a week. Now I tend to rely on recipes I've picked up from restaurants and friends. I enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and figuring out new ways to improve a recipe, as I've done with the one here."""

5018499~"This recipe uses a technique called ""sweating"" to extract maximum flavor from every ingredient. Although sweating adds a step, this stock is still effortless to make and takes only five minutes longer to cook than the Traditional Fish Stock."
5014598~"This stock is even easier to put together than <epi:recipelink id=""105266"">Strong Fish Stockepi:recipelink. It does not require fish heads, only the bones of flat fish — sole, founder, halibut, or turbot — and it doesn’t call for the extra step of sweating the bones. It has a more delicate seafood flavor, and it is not as gelatinous as the Strong Fish Stock, making it very versatile. In addition to chowder and seafood stews like bouillabaisse, you can use this to make fish velouté and delicate French sauces such as Bercy (based on velouté and shallots) or bonnefemme.</epi:recipelink></epi:recipelink>"
5006948~Highly recommended!
5006949~Use the freshest wild or farmed salmon for this dish. Chilling it in the freezer for 20 minutes makes it easier to dice.
5019962~Chicken stock is one of the great all-purpose kitchen preparations, and you’ll be surprised at how useful it is in chowder making. It is unsurpassed as a vehicle for soups and stews, providing nutrients, a luxuriant texture, and a delicious flavor. I am always amazed at how the flavor of chicken stock melts into other flavors and allows them to come through clearly. That’s why it is staple ingredient in most any culture’s soups.

5006955~The big flavors of steaks hold up to vibrant sauces, like this bright condiment from Argentina (which can also double as a marinade).
5006956~Boiling away the butter and seasonings from the leftover vegetables allows the flavors of the marinade to shine through. (If you don't have any leftover veggies, simply steam a mix of your favorites.)
5006957~Sip this beefy, faintly sweet broth as is, or, to make it even heartier, simmer diced root vegetables and/or little pastas in it.
5006958~Chef Kris Wessel of Florida Cookery in Miami Beach, Florida, shared this recipe as part of a Palm Tree Christmas menu he created exclusively for Epicurious. You can also use this orange glaze on a 12-pound bone-in pork loin. See the Cook's Note for cooking times.
5015305~(Djej Emshmel)
5006960~This dish is a bold mix of salty, sweet, and acidic components. Crunchy slabs of melon and sharp greens keep it fresh; meaty chops provide depth.
5006961~This is a great entrée for entertaining or for a special weeknight dinner for your family. Either way, no one except you will know how easy it is to make. And your secret is safe with us.
5006962~The classic cold soup seems almost restrained next to this lusty dish — gazpacho ingredients are grilled, then tossed with pasta and cheese (some of the vegetables are puréed to make a tangy sauce that lightly cloaks the whole). The sausages are cooked separately, so this recipe will come in handy when there are vegetarians around.

5006965~A quick almond crust gets filled with ice cream and topped with cardamom-scented whipped cream and berries.
5006966~This is not a sweet dish—don't be fooled by the first step for the sauce, making a caramel. Browning the sugar brings out savory and bitter notes that balance out the silky, earthy potatoes in an irresistible way. Though this dish is actually a Danish Christmas classic, we think these gorgeous potatoes should be cooked a lot more often than just once a year.
5006967~Highly recommended!
5006968~This recipe originally accompanied bobotie.
5006969~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5006970~As the tart bakes, some of the beet juice will color the custard and the goat cheese, giving each slice a pretty, almost marbleized look. Since the flavors are a riff on the classic beet, walnut, and goat cheese salad, this tart pairs especially well with greens tossed with a bright vinaigrette. A small slice also makes a somewhat unusual but delicious side dish to grilled lamb chops.
5006971~Fiery habaneros impart brightness to a rich pork dish like Yucatecan-style pork.
5016981~This recipe serves 4 as a main course after you set aside one third of the fish (see cooks' note, below) to make the capellini with salmon and lemon-dill-vodka sauce. Otherwise, it serves 6.
5006973~The quinces in this stew are not combined with sugar and therefore will not change color. They require only 45 minutes of cooking time to become tender.
5006974~The cheese and walnut topping adds a touch of elegance to simple steak
5006975~"One of my greatest idols is Ruth Reichl, a clever writer who delightfully manages to approach food with just the right balance of weightiness and sense of humor, the latter often a rare commodity among ""serious"" authors. I love Reichl's recipes, I love her storytelling, and I always benefit from her vast knowledge. This recipe-a rhapsody for sweet, bitter, and salty-is based on one of hers, published in Gourmet Today, a selection from the sadly defunct Gourmet magazine, which Reichl edited for many years."
5006976~Pork all over Denmark is hauntingly tender. Ruggiero was particularly taken with the pork belly she tasted at the restaurant Gammel Mønt—crisp, but succulent and rich. To re-create these qualities, Ruggiero devised a version that requires minimal effort but promises stunning results: Pork shoulder is braised first, until it's super tender, and then flash-seared for a golden crust. The aroma alone will convince you that this unorthodox technique is entirely worthwhile.

5011156~Nothing says Christmas quite like a standing beef rib roast. For starters, it's got good bones. And those bones give it stature—there's nothing petite about this hunk of beef—so it is a commanding presence on your holiday table. That other holiday favorite, beef tenderloin, can't begin to compare in brawn or beefiness.

5007001~Editor's note: This recipe is part of a special Thanksgiving menu created by chefs Allison Vines-Rushing and Slade Rushing of MiLa restaurant in New Orleans. The licorice root is optional, but if used, will add a slightly sweet, woody flavor to this fall soup. If you can't find it locally, the chefs recommend Gourmet Spice Company as an online source.
5010960~For the pesto mixture, executive food editor Kemp M. Minifie switches from pine nuts to pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, and she incorporates flat-leaf parsley in with the basil. To top it all off she adds homemade bread crumbs. It's not quite Italian anymore, but it works.

5007010~Brining ensures moist, succulent meat, and this recipe from Bruce Aidells, chef and founder of Aidells Sausage Company, could not be easier or more low-tech. The special equipment required? Two 30-gallon plastic bags and one very large (16-quart) bowl that will fit in the fridge. You'll want to get started a day ahead, because the turkey is brined for 18 to 20 hours. Stuffing this turkey is not recommended; the brine remaining in the meat may soak into the stuffing during roasting.

Some of our best (and worst) dishes have been the result of enthusiastic experimentation. I used to serve fresh fruit with a cream-cheese-and-marshmallow dip as an easy dessert after big barbecue meals, but we improved on that by adding a cookie crust and ended up with an entirely new dish."""

5007018~Steamed Uku Laulau with Ginger-Scallion Sauce Laulau is the traditional Hawaiian method of wrapping salted fish in taro and ti leaves and then steaming it in the imu. Later, the method was used for salted pork. In this recipe, we get much the same effect using ti leaves in a steamer. Like other snappers, the delicate flesh of the uku is best steamed. The Chinese-style sauce gives the perfect finishing touch without overwhelming the subtle flavors of the fish.
5007019~A creamy risotto might make a main course, but for this Italian dish of braised veal , you might want to bend the rules of one dish cooking to be able to serve a traditional Italian-style side dish. Making risotto is not demanding—you can make it with ease while the veal shanks are braising.
5007020~Anybody who knows me knows that I have a soft spot for cupcakes and soy chai lattes, so combining these two creates my own piece of heaven. These cupcakes are moist, tender, and lightly spicy, thanks to the combination of ginger and cardamom. Go ahead and pair with a steaming hot chai latte...you won’t overdo it.

5007030~Inspired by Spanish flavors, this fried chicken from chef Suzanne Goin of Los Angeles' A.O.C. gets a spicy boost in both the marinade and the seasoned breading. At A.O.C., Goin serves the dish with a romesco aioli. For a similar sauce, combine equal parts romesco and mayonnaise.
5007031~Humble cauliflower and brussels sprouts become luxurious in this decadent gratin.
5007032~In this recipe, a long marinating time allows many powerful ingredients to penetrate the skirt steak: the acid in balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce doesn't just flavor the meat; it also breaks down connective tissues, making the meat tender. Serve this with tabbouleh salad or stewed tomatoes.
5007033~"""For me, cooking is a very relaxing and creative process — I just wish I had more time for it,"" writes Katherine Burk of Seattle, Washington. ""I make a point of fixing dinner during the week, but with my hectic schedule (I work in information technology), there are some nights I'm too wiped out to attempt anything more complicated than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

After you remove the kernels from the cobs, you scrape the corn milk from the cobs with the back of a knife, then simmer the cobs in cream and milk. This mixture forms the base of the pudding batter, which you pour into corn husklined muffin tins. The result is part corn muffin, part soufflé."

The generous pot of aromatic rice, curry-scented chicken, and (much) more can be traced back to Macau, the former Portuguese colony in China, where it's almost always served at home. Chefs Conlon and Lo took inspiration from foreign-language cookbooks; their version is a blend of Portuguese and Chinese cooking that Conlon calls ""the original fusion."""
5007071~This lively salsa is typically served with Argentine asado—beef, pork, or lamb cooked over an open fire or grill. It's also wonderful with a seared skirt steak.
5012850~Using miso on the turkey is a great way to get wonderfully moist meat — always a challenge at Thanksgiving. The skin doesn't get as crisp as it would without, but we think the succulent results are well worth the trade-off. The miso won't give the turkey an Asian flavor, but it will add a rich meatiness to the gravy. Don't use a brined or kosher turkey for this recipe or the bird will be too salty (miso has a high sodium content).
5007073~Cool the apples thoroughly before filling the crust (warm apples could soften the lattice).

5011051~Preserved lemons are perhaps most at home in Moroccan dishes, but we love their complex, bright flavor and aroma in all kinds of soups, stews, and salads. We've adapted Mediterranean-food authority Paula Wolfert's quick method and made it even faster by blanching the lemons first. If you manage to find Meyer lemons, this is a great way to capture their unforgettable taste and perfume.

5007090~I made a beet ravioli dish for the restaurant menu when we first opened, and it remained popular for quite some time. Our regulars weren't at all happy when we finally took it off the menu. On special occasions, such as Valentine's Day, we've brought back variations on that beet ravioli, sometimes using cookie cutters for hearts or other sweet shapes. If you can find them, candy-striped beets are beautiful and unique, or try using golden beets, or even a combination of all three.

5007104~Kierin Baldwin's pie dough method is special in a couple of ways. First, she uses a combination of butter, which lends rich flavor, and shortening, which makes the flakiest crusts. The best of both worlds. Her technique of repeatedly flattening and stacking the dough coats the flour with fat, which helps make the crust tender.

5007130~I named this for Lloyd Kramer, a regular customer and a onetime pretty famous reporter, now director, who's from a suburb outside Boston called Marblehead. Lloyd is on a healthy diet now, but before that, when he ordered what he wanted, this is what he ate. It has a ton of cheese in it. The frozen corn cools down the eggs, allowing me to cook them over a higher fire than I normally cook scrambled eggs and still have really creamy eggs.
5007131~This hearty winter stew has rich, deep flavors that improve if the stew rests in the refrigerator overnight. what to drink: Rioja, Syrah, or any medium-bodied red wine with soft berry fruit and some spice.

5007134~"Todd English — the chef/owner of Olives and the four Figs restaurants, all in and around Boston — was named Best Chef in the Northeast by the James Beard Foundation. He's also the author of two cookbooks. For his ""clambake"" extravaganza, you'll need a grill with a lid."
5018410~Lamb is a classic at Easter, particularly leg of lamb. Increasingly, though, lamb legs are sold boned, or even better, boned and butterflied, which makes them ideal for summer grilling. But for Easter, a boneless lamb leg (readily available at the big-box stores) becomes something irresistible to stuff, and because there's no bone, it's a dream to carve.
5007136~Toss together feathery, pale-green frisée, along with tender, purple-red slices of radicchio, thin semicircles of crisp fennel, and a light mustard vinaigrette to make a gorgeous interplay of colors, textures, and flavors. A generous handful of mint leaves adds a tongue-tingling surprise, reinforcing this salad's zesty freshness.
5007137~The concept of ground almonds and extra-virgin olive oil in a cake may sound like a recipe for a lead weight, but this dessert is surprisingly airy and light yet also amazingly moist. And the bonus of a jigger of Amaretto liqueur can only make it better.
5007138~If you've never cooked with quince before, here's a great intro. It tastes like a cross between an apple and a pear.
5007139~Guinness, the Irish stout, gives the brine for these simple barbecued lamb steaks much of its punch. Like most dark beers, Guinness has a bittersweet molasses flavor, which is great with lamb. But the hidden power of a Guinness brine is its alcohol content (about 4 percent). Alcohol accelerates the absorption of flavorful components directly into the protein structure of meat, yielding a steak that not only retains about 10 percent more moisture, but also is able to deliver a hit of seasoning with every bite. The flavors of chipotle chiles and cumin in the brine are reinforced with a smoky rub and a dark, pungent Guinness BBQ sauce. A word of warning: the sauce burns easily, so only brush it on the meat at the very end of grilling. In fact it is more flavorful served as a table sauce, although the steaks do look nice varnished with glaze.
5007140~This large galette takes root vegetables to the next level. The creamy leek filling and pastry crust make it substantial enough to accompany a few cocktails, and the presentation is sure to impress. Though it requires a few steps, you can make this tart well in advance. Once assembled, just pop it in the freezer wrapped in plastic. On the day of, there's no need to defrost—just brush the tart with egg wash, sprinkle with sea salt, and bake.
5007141~Highly recommended!
5011210~This is a ridiculously easy soup to make. It's tasty and durable, and it gets even better overnight.
5007143~Ted Reader likes to marinate the roast in a coffee porter (a dark beer that's flavored with coffee or with dark malts and highly roasted barley) or a similar beer with body, such as Guinness or a honey brown lager. What to drink: Wyndham Estate 2003 Shiraz, Bin 555, South Eastern Australia ($10).
5008433~The long noodles in this soup — representing longevity — are meant to be slurped up. In Chinese culture, cutting them would symbolize cutting one's life short.
5007145~Caramelized shallots and a dark vinegar glaze turn chops into an extremely flavorful sweet-and-sour dish.
5007146~"Many of the minority peoples of Yunnan traditionally boil a chicken to show respect to their dead. Once the ceremony is finished, they shred the meat and mix it with ginger, garlic, and cilantro to make ""ghost chicken."" The lime in this recipe, unusual for Chinese cooking, suggests the influence of Southeast Asia, which the province borders."
5007147~For a savory and simple dinner, serve this trout with some roasted potatoes and a green salad tossed with pears and crumbled blue cheese.
5007148~This is perfect to serve with some quinoa or wild rice as a main to a non-meat eater, or as a side with some roast chicken for the carnivorous. It's also good served warm the following day with a little grilled tofu added.
5007149~"Just saying the words ""Dungeness crab"" creates a sense of place. Its juiciness and depth of flavor is the secret to this salad because it strikes a perfect balance with the sweet-tart dressing. Don't substitute Atlantic blue crab here; its delicacy won't work to the salad's advantage."
5007150~Bolognese is a hearty sauce that needs a toothy, wide noodle like fresh pappardelle, or a sturdy dried shape like rigatoni.—Mike Easton
5007151~Highly recommended!
5007152~We had to include this fantastic recipe because the marriage of fresh ginger, garlic, mint, feta cheese, spinach, and freshly ground lamb with complementary spicy seasonings grilled over direct heat yields an outstanding flavor. Cover them with Spicy Afghan Green Sauce and you'll be serving one of the most remarkable backyard barbecues ever. Friends who think they don't like lamb will rave about these meatballs.
5007153~In recent years, panini-type grilled sandwiches have taken center stage, but there is nothing like a freshly made club sandwich. The triple-decker here amplifies the classic flavors of a BLT with sliced hard-boiled eggs, chive mayo, and a jumble of herbs.

5007158~This bright vinaigrette is good for a lot more than just grilled eggplant.
5007159~The next time you're serving a salad, add some herbs. Think of them as you would any other green; toss handfuls of dill, mint, basil, and more into peppery leaves like arugula, mizuna, or mustard greens, all of which are assertive enough to allow the herbal notes to shine without overpowering the dish. Top it all off with grilled steak, pork, or chicken, and you've got a perfect summer supper.

They call it that in Canada, the place on both sides of Quebec—joking, joking....Part of the history of Montreal is an overdramatized opposition to Toronto. Maybe it's hockey, maybe it's the separatist thing, or maybe it's just a friendly rivalry. Regardless, we love Toronto. It's where our favorite butcher, Stephen Alexander, has his shops (Cumbrae's) and it's the national capital of oyster bars (Rodney's, Oyster Boy, Starfish). It's also home to Kids in the Hall, John Candy, the Black Hoof, and, of course, the Saint Lawrence Market, where you can get a peameal bacon bun with maple mustard."

5007270~Here, you only boil the rice briefly before combining it with the dried fruit and cooking it without water. We adapted this rice from a Persian method that yields a buttery crust (called tah-dig) on the bottom of the pan — later the crust is served with the rice. Usually you have to dip the pot in cold water at the end of cooking to release the crust, but a happy kitchen accident occurred when we tested this recipe. Food editor Ruth Cousineau let the rice stand for almost an hour (things can get hectic when you're preparing a holiday meal), and the crust came right out without the dipping. Using a heavy pot helps keep the rice hot, too.

5007300~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5007301~Broccoli needn't only be cooked fast until bright green and al dente. In fact the flavor is amplified when it's braised slowly until as tender as can be. You can enjoy this as a vegetable side dish, spoon it over garlic-rubbed bruschetta, or toss it with pasta and freshly grated pecorino or Parmesan cheese.

5007313~Smoky grilled vegetables—not a cloying amount of meat or cheese—rule here. Instead of embellishing the enchiladas with a complex (and time-consuming) Mexican pipián (pumpkin-seed sauce), cook a few customary pipián ingredients and then purée them with cilantro for an easy enchilada that's herbaceous and fresh.
5007314~When shopping for a chicken, look for the organic seal. An organic chicken will be juicier than one that's conventionally raised. In this recipe, the chicken is butterflied for quicker cooking.
5007315~A relatively new item in the produce section, broccolini is a cross between broccoli and Chinese kale. It has a milder, sweeter taste than broccoli. Buy German potato salad, and braise red cabbage to serve warm with the open-face sandwiches. Gingerbread and chunky applesauce make a perfect finale.

5007317~"Antoinette Muto of Los Angeles, California, writes: ""My business partner and I own a company that makes costumes for the film industry. When we are involved in a huge project — as we were with Minority Report and X2 — we work very long days, and sometimes even on weekends. So I don't have much time to cook or even to go out for lunch or dinner. That's when my no-fiddling cooking style comes in handy. I cut corners when I can — without sacrificing flavor. I prepare all-vegetarian meals, using the freshest ingredients from the farmers' market, and I really get a kick out of seeing people come over to my house and not miss the meat one bit."""

5007321~This soup features the flavors of India: aromatic nigella seeds, curry powder, curry leaves, and cumin seeds.
5007322~Try these tossed into stir-fries, as a burrito filling, or folded into sautéed greens.
5019261~Grill the vegetables once the chickens have finished cooking. Because the artichokes have been precooked, it takes just a few minutes to finish them on the grill.
5007324~"This ""salsa"" is actually a sort of fruit salad, but it does contain the quintessential salsa ingredients, lime juice and jalapeño peppers. The jalapeños are certainly unexpected, but they have an interesting way of intensifying the sweetness of the pineapple."
5007325~We like to whip up this delicious tofu scramble with home fries made from Yukon Gold and sweet potatoes on lazy weekend mornings. Begin to cook the scramble just as the home fries are nearly browned to perfection so you can serve this hearty and soul—satisfying breakfast all at once. It tastes and looks great when accompanied by salsa or chopped tomatoes and a handful of garden—fresh herbs.
5007326~Oysters on the half shell with a cold sauce of vinegar, peppercorns and finely chopped lemongrass would be an elegant appetizer. Accompany the pork with the rice timbales , steamed snow peas and baby corn, and a dry Gewürztraminer. End with a salad of melon and pineapple with toasted coconut.

5007333~Pureed squash adds wonderful color.
5007334~A beef tenderloin roast is a boon for the host and a treat for family or guests during the holidays. Many big-box stores sell them at a reasonable price, and when trimmed, there's no waste—just solid meat. Cooking the roast doesn't tie up your oven for long, and once it's done, it couldn't be easier to carve. Between the green of the rosemary and the red of the grape tomatoes, the sauce is festive with color and loaded with bright flavor.
5007335~These scones are terrific with butter and honey or marmalade.
5007336~When creative director Richard Ferretti came to Gourmet two and a half years ago, he brought along a recipe for homemade fresh ricotta. It is more delicate in flavor than any store-bought version and has a lovely dry curd. Some of us make it at home often because it takes just a few minutes of active time. Topped with honey and cinnamon, it's also great for dessert.
5007337~Highly recommended!
5007338~"Although this is a chilled beverage, it is traditionally enjoyed in the winter. The ""fire"" of the cinnamon and ginger is supposed to warm you up, while the coolness of the beverage balances the heat.

5007343~Sephardic Jews from Turkey, Greece, Morocco, and other countries of the Mediterranean region say seven special blessings over seven different symbolic foods at their Rosh Hashanah dinner. Five of these blessings are over vegetables — apples (candied or dipped in sugar or honey), leeks, beet greens or spinach, dates, and zucchini or squash. These blessings symbolize their hopes for the New Year. Many of these Jews trace their ancestors back to Spain, which is called Sepharad in the Bible. Over the centuries, the Sephardic Jews took advantage of the abundance of vegetables available in the Mediterranean countries, often throughout the year. Among these vegetables are sweet potatoes and squash, great favorites of my family. The special blessing you can say over your sweet potatoes and squash at the beginning of your Rosh Hashanah dinner goes like this:

5007345~"""Shark and bake,"" a popular Trinidadian pocket sandwich, is found at beach shacks and street stalls throughout the island. Part of its appeal is the variety of go-withs, from mango chutney to sliced cucumbers. ""Bake"" is a catchall term for several types of bread, grilled or fried."

5014594~This is really a base for other soups that can also be served on it's own — but consider adding some jalapeño pepper, cilantro, and lime juice; or diced tomato, chopped parsley, matchsticks of zucchini, and thinly sliced basil; cooked peas and small leaves of spinach; lemongrass, curry leaves, and lime juice; or any other seasoning group that seems enjoyable.
5007350~If whole blanched almonds aren't available, substitute whole raw almonds with skin on.
5007351~Here triangles of tofu are panfried, simmered briefly in half the nut butter sauce, and garnished with slivered scallion and sesame seeds. The rest of the sauce can be spooned over brown rice, noodles, or whatever you choose as an accompaniment. If possible, present the tofu in the pan that it's cooked in.

5007354~Highly recommended!
5007355~"Taiglach (little pieces of fried dough dredged in honey) are eaten for celebratory occasions like Rosh Hashanah, Sukkot, Simchat Torah, Chanukah, Purim, weddings, and births. Ceciarchiata means ""chickpeas"" or ""little bits"" in Italian. This festive taiglach is similar in nature to the French croquembouche, though it's a crown, not a mountain. It is a spectacular centerpiece with its clusters of dough and nuts, and is totally addictive."
5016214~"""One thing I cannot get out of my head"" said Ben Moskovitz, owner of Star Bakery in Oak Park, Michigan. ""Was the food better growing up in Czechoslovakia or were the people hungrier there? My mother made a honey cake for the holiday, and it was so delicious. Honey was too expensive for us, so my mother burned the sugar to make it brown. Here I use pure honey, but I still think my mother's cake was better and I know I am wrong. The taste of hers is still in my mouth."""
5007357~Steaming unlocks the succulence of okra. Here, the pods are tossed with slivered ginger and a Vietnamese-inspired scallion oil in an all-purpose dish that's great with grilled steak or chicken, or with nothing more than a fragrant bowlful of jasmine rice.
5007358~This sweet and savory stuffing can be made two weeks ahead and frozen. Defrost it in the refrigerator the night before Thanksgiving.

5007369~I’m sort of a snob when it comes to trying new recipes. I just seem to like my old tried and true ones best, and it takes a lot for something new to grab my attention. I had to have the recipe for this dip after I tried it on Super Bowl Sunday 2006. Garth is a die-hard Steelers fan, so it was an exciting day. Everybody always brings something for the party, and this was my friend Kim’s contribution. Being a good southern girl, I love anything with black-eyed peas in it, but for you folks who are right now turning up your noses at the idea of eating black-eyed peas, all I can say is just try it. In fact, maybe I should name it something else for those skeptics. How about Pea Dippy?
5007370~A tangerine's skin is so thin that when it's cooked, you can eat the fruit—peel and all. Asian sweet chili sauce is an orange-colored, slightly spicy bottled Thai sauce; it's available in the As ian foods section of some supermarkets. Chinese five-spice powder can be found in the spice section of most supermarkets.

5007375~Pretty, sophisticated, and easy to eat.
5007376~"I can just hear someone shouting ""Oh, no, not quinoa again,"" but this is really good. I made it for friends who cannot eat onions or garlic. Looking around for a solution, I found that the freezer had two plastic containers of Boletus mushrooms that I had picked, cooked, and frozen in the summer. If—as is probable—fresh Boletus are not available, use another good mushroom. Even if you don't forage as I do, you will find an expanding selection of flavorful mushrooms in shops—labeled ""wild"" only to differentiate them from regular mushrooms. They need not be frozen. In fact, they will need to be defrosted if frozen.
Don't worry if this makes more than you need. My friends took home the remains, and so will yours."
5009583~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5007378~This California-style burger was tested numerous times to perfect and ensure that the patties are crisp, firm, tasty, and delicious. The combination of rolled oats, raw walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseed meal will keep you totally full on protein and fiber. Top with delicious avocado slices, and you've got a veggie burger unlike any you've ever tasted! The patties will last up to a week, refrigerated.
5007379~Made with decaffeinated coffee, this soothing drink is ideal for sipping while watching a video on a lazy Saturday night.
5007380~BLT, hold the bread (you won't miss it). Big chunks of sun-ripened tomato and soft leaves of butterhead lettuce—Boston or Bibb, for instance—are topped with a creamy blue cheese dressing (fine-tuned with a wizardly touch of bacon fat) and plenty of crisp homemade bacon bits. It is a familiar yet striking kickoff to a bucolic meal seriously focused on produce.

5007386~Highly recommended!
5007387~A swirl of orange marmalade adds a welcome bittersweet note to vanilla ice cream.
5007388~I could eat a meal like this almost every night. It's light and fresh, with vegetables and flaky fish poached in a perfumed broth. Five-spice powder is a Chinese spice blend combining equal parts cinnamon, star anise, clove, fennel, and Szechuan peppercorns, and can be found these days in most well-stocked grocery stores. A spa meal without the sacrifice, the chewy udon noodles and bok choy soak up that brothy flavor and round out this quick meal perfectly. Who said eating well was hard work?

5007398~The mushroom and herb topping is similar in texture to bread stuffing. After baking, the fish has a moist center and a delicately crisp top. Partner it with a chilled Viognier.
5007399~Serve with: A black bean salad and burger toppings like pepper Jack cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. Hamburger buns are optional. Dessert: Dulce de leche ice cream and sliced strawberries.
5007400~Harissa, the basic flavoring agent in Tunisian cuisine, is extremely versatile. Use it as a condiment for grilled meat or fish, add it to roasted vegetables, or stir into stews and soups. We particularly like it with couscous or rice. Adjust the amount of heat by increasing or reducing the number of chiles. Just remember, it is meant to be hot!
5007401~"A fusion dish from Phyllis Vaccarelli of Let's Get Cookin', in Westlake Village, California. The flavors are basically Italian, but before cooking, the shrimp are coated with a ""velveting"" mixture of cornstarch and egg white used in traditional Chinese cooking, which helps keep the shrimp tender. Serve a watercress salad with balsamic dressing alongside. For dessert, construct a sundae with vanilla ice cream, diced mangoes and crushed amaretti cookies."

5007413~At the restaurant, this dish is drizzled with tomato sauce, then garnished with salami and sautéed zucchini.
5007414~The glaze, which goes on the asparagus as well as the steak, has a rich sweetness that is transformed into something wonderfully complex once it hits the heat of the grill.
5007415~This dish is a summery variation on the Northern Italian pairing of tomato-braised ossobuco and saffron-flavored risotto. Here the delicious classic combination is lightened up with orzo and wilted grape tomatoes.
5007416~Steamed artichokes would be a great beginning. Accompany the delicate and sophisticated goat cheese souffl with a mixed green salad, whole wheat baguette and some sliced tomatoes. Wrap up chocolate-dipped strawberries and shortbread cookies.
5009028~Highly recommended!
5007418~Chicken cacciatore is a ubiquitous dish in Italian-American restaurants, but we think it is even more delicious when made with veal shoulder roast. Slowly braising the meat in a heady tomato sauce enriched with pancetta, olives, and porcini produces a dish so good, you'll find yourself sneaking nibbles all the way to the table. It's even better the next day—if you can contain yourself.
5007419~Highly recommended!
5007420~"Despite its name, the ""hot ajvar"" called for in this recipe from Zov Karamardian, of Zovs Bistro and Bakery in Tustin, California, is fairly mild. If you cant find ajvar, a substitute can be made by pureeing a seven-ounce can of drained roasted bell peppers with two tablespoons of tomato paste and two tablespoons of purchased chili-garlic sauce, which is available at most supermarkets."
5007421~There are many packaged side dishes on the market, but we particularly like curried couscous. Here, it becomes a main course. Serve with: Warm flatbread and spinach salad with citrus vinaigrette.
5007422~"You can also bake this candy bar of a tart in an 8x8"" pan, but whatever you do, toast those nuts."
5007423~Healthy bonus: Manganese from fruit; antioxidants and fiber from berries; selenium from egg
5007424~If you can't find sorghum syrup, a combination of honey and molasses works nicely.
5007425~"Fools are traditionally prepared with pureed fruit mixed with whipped cream, or egg custard, or a combination of the two. (The term fool probably comes from the French fouler, meaning ""to crush."") They seem to be especially successful when made with sharply flavored garden produce like rhubarb, gooseberries, and black currants, which still have enough bite to be interesting when blended with cream. But strawberries, which are much easier to find, also work quite nicely. Strawberry fool is best when the fruit is mashed rather than pureed, resulting in a more appealing texture. Serve it with cookies."
5007426~This recipe embraces the incredible natural sweetness of sweet potatoes but gives it a spicy edge.
5007788~Highly recommended!
5007428~"The King's Cake (galette des rois), in whatever form it took, with a ""bean"" baked into it, has been the king of desserts on Twelfth Night, also known as the Feast of Kings or Epiphany in France, since the Middle Ages. In those days, the French King's Cake took different forms depending on the region. It was a brioche topped with candied fruits in Provence, a flat galette with cream in the North, a dry cake in Lorraine, a puff pastry round with an almond flavored filling in Lyon. À Paris, it was a gorenflot, a sort of enriched bread raised with baker's yeast, something like a Polish brioche. The ritual of this shared cake is symbolic of the day of the Epiphany, commemorating the presentation of Jesus to the Magi on the sixth of January, but it is also redolent of other pagan traditions linked to the cult of fertility that was so popular with the Romans. The ""bean"" hidden inside the cake was originally an actual lima bean, a symbol of renewal and fecundity, before it was replaced by a tiny porcelain figure representing the Christ child, then by a host of trinkets."

5007449~Once the soup is processed, the addition of extra yogurt adds a creamy texture. The diced cucumber and radishes add a crunchy texture. If hothouse cucumbers are not available, substitute the firm garden variety and double the amount called for. Peel cucumbers and halve lengthwise, then seed.
5007450~Variations of this seasoning are found all over the Middle East. It's used to flavor eggs and is also served with pita—dunk warm flatbread in good olive oil and then the spice dip. The kind sold dried (with dried thyme) in Middle Eastern stores just doesn't compare to za'atar made fresh.

5007453~"These satisfying tarts may incite ""vegetarian envy"" in your meat-eating guests. The recipe makes 4 sizable main-course portions, but the tarts could be halved (or even quartered) to serve as a side dish. Either way, they are delicious with the roasted mushroom and barley gravy."
5007454~Highly recommended!
5007455~As all southerners know, eating Hoppin' John—black-eyed peas and rice—on New Year's Day ensures good luck. But it is the collards, traditionally eaten alongside, that bring good fortune! An added bonus to cooking up a mess o' greens is the resultant pot liquor—the delicious, nutritious broth left in the bottom of the cooking pot or serving dish. It is usually served as an accompaniment to that last piece of corn bread.
5007456~This marshmallow frosting recipe was inspired by one of my favorite cookbook authors, the late Elaine Gottschall. It works especially well with S'mores and is divine frosted over Chocolate Cake or sandwiched between Chewy Chocolate Cookies. Don't fear if the mixture overcooks and the agave nectar turns dark amber—you will have roasted marshmallow frosting, creating a slightly different, though equally tasty, treat.
5007457~Fresh fennel adds crunch and goat cheese lends tang to this meatless pizza.

You'll find crisp-tender Romano beans and green beans, as well as droves of firm yet creamy fava beans (also called broad beans), which have been a staple in places like Egypt, China, and the Mediterranean for millennia. The beans are all cooked in one pot and then warmed in a skillet, where verdant shreds of basil join them at the last minute for extra oomph. Sound easy? That's because it is.

5007509~"Joe Dion of North Charleston, South Carolina, writes: ""Because I work in a restaurant (I'm a chef at a place called Slightly North of Broad in Charleston), I don't let my cooking at home get too complicated. I'm at the restaurant five days a week and often work on weekends, but whenever I have the chance I enjoy getting together with friends and cooking for them."""
5007510~We've been making chef Scott Howard's ginger syrup in bulk and keeping it in the fridge for quick tonics and late- evening cocktails. If you have a juicer at home, by all means use it, but good store-bought 100 percent carrot juice will work just as well here.

5007542~Frieda Caplan, doyenne of the produce company Frieda's, introduced the U.S. to the kiwi in the sixties. It took a few years, but in the seventies, the green fruit with the fuzzy brown skin really took off.
5007543~This fresh new take on classic horseradish sauce makes a lot, but you’re going to want extra. It’s the perfect companion for both our Porcini-Rubbed Beef Rib Roast and our Crispy Baby Yukon Gold Potatoes.

5007545~For an elegant change of pace from store-bought tortilla chips, fry thin slices of plantain at home. When slipped into hot oil, the plantains curve into beautiful, long strips. Delicately flavored and impossibly crisp, these chips are great for dipping in guacamole.

5007557~After he went on the Blue Voyage, Boston chef Chris Schlesinger came up with the idea for this recipe, which brings together many of the characteristic flavors of Turkey's Mediterranean coast. Halibut works best, but you can use any mild, firm-fleshed white fish.

Then fill the basket with spinach, submerge it in the water, and stir the spinach to release dirt. Lift the basket out and repeat with fresh water.
5007570~Highly recommended!
5016684~The problem with Franco-American food trends, like the current one with macarons—those pastel puffs of sweet air that seem to be everywhere—is that its good ol' American predecessor, the macaroon, gets forgotten. The truth is, though, we never stopped loving the coconut macaroon. In fact, we craved its dense, moist chew. Retrofit the macaroon as a bite-size sandwich filled with a pucker-worthy tart lime curd, and you've caught a new trend headed straight for the stars.
5018780~Highly recommended!
5007573~Highly recommended!
5007574~This recipe is based on a classic Irish dish called champ. It is typically made with onions or scallions, but we've used chives—and parsley as well. You can create simple variations with parsley or chives alone, or go all out with a combination of sautéed leeks, caramelized onions, and fresh peas.
5007575~An easy press-in crust of ground graham crackers and toasted almonds is topped with a fresh strawberry filling and whipped cream. Chill the pie at least two hours before serving.
5007576~This savory custard features creamy Gorgonzola and the sweet succulence of leeks. Let it precede an entrée of barbecued steak or duck breast for a guest dinner. You can assemble it in advance and bake at the last minute, or bake it ahead and reheat to serve. Finish the dishes with Parmesan cheese for a sharp bite, or sugar for a sweet touch.
5007577~Of all the rich and succulent winter squash varieties, delicata, with its long and uniformly narrow shape, is the easiest to work with. And its thin, pale-golden skin with green striations is more than just pretty — it's edible, too.
5007578~Highly recommended!
5013635~Delicious with seafood and veggies.
5007580~The French dessert that's known as clafouti is a pancake crossed with a fruit-filled custard. It's best served warm, right from the skillet. If you don't have a cast-iron skillet, any ovenproof variety is fine. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
5007581~Highly recommended!
5007582~The yellow pepper mole may have lots of ingredients, but the result is a delightfully complex sauce. Golden raisins and white chocolate preserve the golden color of the roasted peppers, and while those may sound sweet, onion, garlic, and tomatillos keep the sauce savory, fresh, and never cloying. At the restaurant we give this a hint of smoked red pepper sauce and cilantro oil and garnish it with cilantro.

5007586~Use a vegetable peeler to peel the zucchini lengthwise into thin ribbons, stopping when you get to the very center where it is all seeds. You can use this same technique with carrots and peel long carrot ribbons, or also choose to use half carrots and half zucchini. The zucchini (or carrots or both) sliced this way also make a light, fresh summer salad when tossed raw with lemon juice, olive oil, and fresh herbs.

We're also giving you five reasons to leave the ketchup in the fridge, with homemade dipping-sauce recipes for Sour Cream and Onion Dip , Saffron Mayonnaise , Ginger-Sesame Sauce , Roasted Red PepperWalnut Dip , and Chipotle-Tomatillo Sauce .
5007592~At the first nip in the air, I start looking for fresh butternut squash at farmers' markets, just so I can make this soup. Considered a Thanksgiving classic, this versatile and universally loved soup is simply too tasty to enjoy only once a year. Now that peeled and precut butternut squash is available in grocery stores year-round, you can make this easy three-step—roast, blend, and simmer—soup anytime you like. Like apple or pear butter, pumpkin butter is gently cooked with some sugar until it's smooth and has a buttery texture. Look for pumpkin butter near the jams and jellies in your grocery store.
5007593~"Self-crowned ""BBQ Queens"" Karen Adler and Judith Fertig have written more than 20 cookbooks between the two of them, including Weeknight Grilling with the BBQ Queens. Their tuna burger is infused with Mediterranean flavor and topped with a favorite New Orleans sauce."

5014522~It's hard to imagine anything better than freshly picked ears of corn roasting to golden-brown goodness on the grill. One taste of our Honey-Ginger Barbecue Sauce and you'll be wondering why you ever stuck to plain ol' butter. This sweet and tangy sauce transforms the season's staple produce into a standout, flame-kissed favorite.
5007609~The fennel seeds turn into an aromatic, crunchy crust on the skin.
5007610~This is the perfect antidote to the Sunday blues, not least because there will be enough left over to pack sandwiches for Monday's lunch. A mix of beef, pork, and bacon ensures meatiness, with Worcestershire sauce, chopped prunes, and cider vinegar added for good balance and occasional suggestions of sweetness. Because the loaf is baked without a loaf pan, there's plenty of well-browned crust to go around.
5007611~A fall favorite that's topped with vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream.

5007617~Basil is wilted like a leafy green in this stir-fry, then added raw at the end for a double dose of its aromatic flavor.
5007618~Apricots have roughly 60 percent more immunity-enhancing beta-carotene—which can help you fend off colds and flu—than their closest fruit competitor, cantaloupe. Consider a slice sniffle prevention!
5007619~Delicious when served hot, this pasta dish is made for the culinarily creative—feel free to use your favorite mushrooms for a recipe all your own.
5019226~Make this bread, which is used in the Southwest Corn Bread Stuffing with Corn and Green Chilies and Southern Corn Bread Stuffing with Smoked Ham and Yams recipes, at least one day and up to two days ahead of time.
5007621~When we opted to cut out grains from our diet, one of the hardest things to give up was, strangely enough, stuffing—the kind you eat with Thanksgiving dinner. Most stuffing is made with bread crumbs, and that just wouldn't do. So Ryan put a lot of effort into developing and testing more nutritious alternatives, and eventually came up with this—a delicious and more-than-satisfying substitute. When they taste it for the first time, many people want to know his secret. They're shocked when he tells them it's omitting the bread crumbs.
5007622~Yellow tomatoes — which are typically sweeter than red ones — flavor a sunny Golden State version of the chilled summer soup. Begin preparing this recipe one day before you plan to serve it.

5007639~New York strip loin, also called top loin of beef, is a succulent, elegant roast. If you want a lot of leftovers (they are great for sandwiches), use a seven-pound roast and multiply the seasonings by 1 1/2. Either way, have your butcher trim some of the fat, leaving about 1/4 inch for the best flavor. With this as your entrée, uncork a Cabernet Sauvignon.

5007642~Serve these pancakes immediately, since they do not keep well in a warm oven.
5007643~This pie crust is light, flaky tender and very crisp. It has a glorious butter flavor and is an ideal container for any pie or tart recipe. I strongly recommend commercial or homemade pastry flour, as it will result in a more tender crust than one made with all-purpose flour.

5007663~In a classic confit, meat cooks (and is then preserved) in its own fat. Here, lemons cook in their own juices to become the basis for an overnight marinade.
5007664~"The ""crumble"" in this case is a buttery shortbread topping."
5007665~A great way to use very ripe bananas, this easy-to-make cake incorporates everything you love about banana bread and adds a few more favorites—chocolate, walnuts, and cinnamon—for good measure. (It's also much more tender, with a light, moist crumb.)
5007666~Highly recommended!
5007667~Tuna is delicious when it is cooked like steak with a reduced wine gravy made in the pan. Add any fresh herbs you have on hand — chives, tarragon, basil, parsley, oregano. Here the steaks are accompanied by fragrant thyme-scented white beans.
5007668~A V-slicer or mandoline is the perfect tool for thinly slicing the fennel. The fresh apricots add a nice sweetness to the salad, but feel free to skip them if they're not available in your area.
5007669~I've been doing the previous marinades forever. This new one is first cousin to a good barbecued tofu: piquant, sweet-hot-rich, and scintillatingly tasty. The tofu is baked in the marinade/sauce, which cooks down and coats it, caramelizing them. You'll probably have to soak the baking dish overnight before washing it, but it's worth it. Vary this using fruit juice concentrate instead of honey or sugar, and adding extra ginger, orange zest, or both. For an incendiary smokiness, add chipotle in adobo.
5007670~Here are potatoes with Italian flavor.
5007671~This Flintstonian cut is impressive, and the bone lends flavor as the meat braises. But if you prefer, a boneless tied leg of lamb is a little more manageable and cooks more quickly.
5007672~"The lively flavor of this ice is a perfect accompaniment to fruit salad. The key to its smooth texture is making a ginger ""tea,"" then combining it with the remaining ingredients, rather than simply incorporating pieces of ginger into the custard mixture."

5007677~Look for whole cardamom pods in the spice section of your supermarket or in Indian markets (do not substitute ground cardamom). And if your store doesn’t carry blood oranges, use navel oranges instead.
5007678~"This has to be one of the oldest porch drinks. My grandmother once told me it was the soft drink of her generation (that, and Coca-Cola, which, with a trace of cocaine in its early days, put a pep in her step). Shrubs make great use of fresh fruits—blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, you name it—and are kept in concentrate form, which, tightly covered, will keep in your refrigerator for a couple of weeks (just whisk it to incorporate the sugar ""foam"" that forms on top). Don't be alarmed by the vinegar; the sugar and water tone it down, leaving it most enjoyable. This could be made into a punch by pouring the shrub concentrate into a large bowl and adding 12 to 14 cups of water followed by ice cubes."

But treat those same drumsticks to a long, slow, moist braise in barbecue sauce, and the meat falls off the bones, revealing tough tendons so numerous, you won't believe it.
Barbecue is a very personal subject for a lot of Americans. Some like it sweet, while others like it tangy, so season the mixture to your taste at the end of cooking. Above all, have fun with these cuties. Serve the sliders alongside the slices of breast and thigh meat at the big meal, or set them out with drinks for game-day fare. They'll disappear fast!"

5007764~Burrata, an ultra-creamy fresh mozzarella, is available at specialty cheese shops.
5007765~Unlike most tamal recipes, which use dried corn (masa harina), this one is Cuban-style, made with fresh corn kernels. I've also added a different touch by replacing the traditional pork filling with conch. The flavor and texture proved very popular at Yuca, and it remained on the menu as a fixture.
5007766~Serve these with a salad and some sausage for a hearty main course.
5007767~Begin the meal with a salad of endive, pear and watercress with a blue cheese vinaigrette. The lamb is wonderful with the onion-potato gratin and boiled haricots verts; Côte-Rôtie is the right wine. A French apple tart from the bakery topped with some sweetened créme fraîche makes a nice ending.
5007768~Since lima and fava beans have a shorter growing season than most local tomatoes, we've given frozen edamame, available year-round, as an alternative to make this recipe more versatile.
5007769~(TARTELETTES AUX NOIX)
5007770~When I was little, I would beg my mom to make pork chops, because she'd top them with this sweet, sticky condiment called Saucy Susan. It's a sort of jam made from apricots, and ever since she first combined the two ingredients, I've been obsessed with how well the fruit goes with pork. Nowadays, I pay homage to the sweet-tart flavor of the fruit by brining the loin in apricot nectar and later building upon the flavors with a glaze made from apricot preserves and lemon.
5007771~There's a touch of lemon in this summer pie.
5007772~An homage to the prehistoric pitmasters: giant steaks cooked directly on hot coals. This method gives you a steak that's moist on the inside and pleasantly charred on the outside. Be sure to use hardwood lump charcoal (not briquettes) for this recipe. It will burn cleaner, hotter, and faster than traditional charcoal.
5011911~Ginger and garlic give these pea pods a hint of Asian flavor, but we think they're a good all-purpose side dish.

Like deviled eggs, it's devilishly simple and satanically good. It can be spread on pieces of celery or toast points. Those who do not want to use ham can substitute smoked chicken or smoked turkey.

Since I can whip it up in about twenty minutes flat using only a skillet and a baking dish, this is one condition I'm only too happy to comply with. Most of the time I make it with lean ground turkey. But you can also swap out the turkey and use lean ground beef. This cheesy baked casserole is packed with Mexican flavor, from the spice of the taco seasoning and tomato salsa right on down to the creamy black beans and sweet corn tortillas. It's seriously tasty, seriously easy, and seriously, it's good for you.

5007815~The bite of mustard and the char of the grill amp up the flavor of tender but mild-tasting filet mignon. Be sure to have all the sauce ingredients ready to go before starting the meat. For perfect timing, add the cream to the sauce while the steaks are resting; they'll be done at the same time.
5007816~Kids and adults alike will enjoy this lunch. Store this tasty salad in a wide-mouthed thermal container, use several Bibb or Boston lettuce leaves to wrap around the salad instead of bread, and pack the nuts separately in a little plastic bag for sprinkling. For those who can take the heat, add a splash of Chinese hot oil or hot sesame oil to the salad.

Like their Italian cousins — the tortelli di zucca from Lombardy — they are prepared like ravioli, but the similarity ends there. The dough, though not a pasta dough, is very thinly rolled and made with olive oil. The barbajuans are fried to a golden crispiness rather than boiled or baked, and they are served with aperitifs rather than as a first course."

5007875~While you can make a very nice vanilla sugar by simply plunging a vanilla bean into a jar of sugar and leaving it there (for a really, really long time), I actually like to make a slightly fancier version by processing vanilla and sugar together until the bean is all broken down and the sugar is speckled with countless tiny beans and specks of pod. The sugar is more intensely flavored than regular vanilla sugar. Packaged in a pretty glass jar, it also makes for a great gift.
5007876~Begin making this one day ahead. If you plan to take this on a sailing trip or a picnic, grill the chicken at home, then transport it in a cooler and serve it cold, or let it stand at room temperature up to two hours. Crusty bread and white wine are perfect accompaniments.
5007877~Although bay leaves in this recipe smell delicious and look enticing, they should not be eaten because of their sharp edges.

By the twentieth century, this new version came to be called Manhattan clam chowder (some historians say that it was also called Coney Island clam chowder and Fulton Market clam chowder). It is believed that disdainful New Englanders named the red-stained chowder after Manhattan because they believed New Yorkers were the only ones crazy enough to add tomato to a pristine white chowder.
5007947~"Thanks to a zingy ginger, garlic, and miso paste mixture, these vitamin- and fiber-loaded mushroom and zucchini ""meatballs"" are so packed with flavor you'll hardly realize they're missing the traditional meaty ingredient.

They probably feel as my mother does: ""True jumbo lump crabmeat is the caviar of Louisiana."" We want to highlight the crabmeat, not mask it with heavy binders or frying, so this has no bread crumbs and only a small amount of binder. And the cakes are _not_fried, making them incredibly light. As for the accompaniment, crab and corn are a classic Creole combination."

5008053~From the rich broth to the velvety cubes of winter melon — a gourd commonly used in Chinese cuisine for the wonderfully soft texture it takes on during cooking — this wholesome soup is immensely satisfying. Although the winter melon's delicate white flesh has no distinct taste of its own, it absorbs the broth's flavor. We recommend buying a good-quality organic free-range chicken to get the best results. Since Chinese ham is unavailable in the United States, we substitute Smithfield ham. But other cured hams, such as prosciutto, also work well.

The tofu is there, but it doesn't intrude. And this is a method you can use with virtually any puréed soup. If you wish, you can purée the entire soup or leave it textured, with bits of sweet potatoes and peppers.

5008113~Highly recommended!
5008114~If you don't have a rice cooker, this is the way to prepare absolutely perfect rice. The liquid cooks down before you cover the pot, so you have more control over how much liquid evaporates; this makes all the difference between mushy and fluffy rice.
5008115~For this noodle bowl, I took inspiration from Heidi Swanson’s Black Sesame Otsu in Super Natural Every Day, in which a blanket of black sesame seeds is toasted until it smells heady, then pounded with a mortar and pestle and combined with some Asian pantry staples to make a thick, savory, and tangy dressing, here given a bit more punch with wasabi. Like other cold noodle dishes, this is a good dish for packing up, and in my experience has been wonderful on the beach. The shredded egg and wisps of radish incorporate into the noodles, the shallot brings crunch and zing, and the final drizzle of kecap manis—the Indonesian soy sauce— brings the whole bowl together in the most satisfying way.

5018447~Roasting the turkey and vegetables before simmering them results in a dark stock that takes you more than halfway to a rich brown gravy. The recipe yields enough for the gravy and then some, but you'll be happy to have the extra when it comes time to make soup.

5008132~Made with yogurt instead of cream, this pureed soup is deceptively light. The green apple peels, thinly sliced and fried, make a delicious garnish.
5008133~This recipe includes a little citrusy butter melted over the vegetable once they are out of the oven. If you're feeding kids, though, remember that they sometimes prefer their roasted vegetables plain. When carrots or other roots are at their best, that's how I like them, too.
5008134~The classic combo is back — and bacon makes it better than ever.
5008135~This is more of an infusion than a true tea, since it isn't made with tea leaves. You will have leftover spice tea to store.

5008138~The following hors d'oeuvre, a variation on the BLT, can be put together quickly if the ingredients are prepared a few hours ahead and assembled just before serving. Finely diced mozzarella would be a nice addition to the salad filling.
5008139~To many people living in the middle of the country, celebration cakes must be chocolate cakes — especially German chocolate cakes. This one embellishes the tradition, using unsweetened chocolate instead of sweet chocolate, a luscious caramel-coconut filling between the layers and lots of creamy chocolate frosting. (By the way, German chocolate cakes have nothing to do with the immigrants who settled in the heartland; the name actually comes from the fact that the cakes were first made with Baker's brand German's sweet baking chocolate.)

5008149~Often found at shacks on the beach in Puerto Rico, this full-flavored crab dish is served in the shell, or with rice and green bananas or plantains. A defining element of the dish is sofrito, a traditional Spanish sauce of tomatoes, onions, garlic, bell peppers, cilantro, and hot pepper.
5008150~Vanilla ice cream is just the right accompaniment to these cookies; orange segments would be a fresh, pretty garnish.
5008151~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5008152~With its sweet taste and firm flesh, mahimahi lends itself well to poaching. Halibut, swordfish and salmon would also be good prepared this way. Serve glasses of chilled Sémillon or Chardonnay to go with the main course.

Choose any combination of the ripest, most fragrant stone fruit (if, say, nectarines aren't looking great, swap in good-looking apricots). Chill the sangria before serving; the flavor will improve the longer it sits—up to two days.

5008166~Let's just dive in, shall we? Not only does this produce a thick and creamy vanilla frosting, it also doubles as a whipped topping, and left unrefrigerated it becomes a vanilla sauce to serve with crumbs, shortcakes, or volcanoes. And why stop there? I especially love the sauce on savory bites like corn bread, muffins, and biscuits, where it acts like a decadent sweet butter. If you try to steer clear of soy, replace the liquid and powdered soy with the rice milk variety for both in equal measure—but be advised that the result will taste slightly sweeter. Please note: If it's true frosting you want, be sure to factor in the full six hours for it to chill and set.
5008167~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5008168~These falafels can be prepared as crusts for use in the Middle Eastern Plate, or they can be made into more traditional falafel balls. To make these balls, just follow the instructions below but roll the mixture into 1-inch balls, then dehydrate them for only 8 to 10 hours.
5008169~Asian ingredients—from soy sauce to sriracha—flavor the pork burgers. Wrapping it all up in Bibb lettuce leaves adds a fresh touch.
5008170~If you're pressed for time, you can sub 1 1/2 cups canned beans for the dried. There's no need to precook the canned beans—just drain and rinse them before adding them to the onions.
5008171~The sauce in this recipe is also good with chicken and ham.

5008174~Always make more salad dressing than you'll need. It takes no longer to mix a big batch, and it means tomorrow night's salad will be ready in minutes. This recipe makes enough vinaigrette for three large salads.
5008175~Work more soy into your diet with this delicious vegetarian dish. Serve with: rice noodles or steamed rice.
5008176~This comforting broth has the flavour of home at Easter for me. You'll need brisket or silverside for this recipe, and the cooking process is long and slow, but it makes the meat tender and juicy.
5008177~Here, cauliflower lightens traditional mashed potatoes and blends in seamlessly. A touch of butter is all you need to make them rich and sumptuous. Steaming the vegetables instead of boiling them helps preserve their vitamin C.
5008178~A versatile dish for the family or for casual entertaining. The chili is also good without the cornmeal topping, served with corn bread alongside.
5008179~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5008192~The honey is optional because some carrots are sweeter than others. Taste the salad, then decide whether to drizzle.

5008207~Salmon are gorgeous, and a whole one — completely boned — makes a breathtaking centerpiece. A savory stuffing of roasted fennel and plum tomatoes transforms the fish into a meal in itself, complemented by a creamy basil sauce with orange zest and saffron.
5008208~Kind of a cross between a steamed pudding and a brownie, this rich-tasting dessert has only 1 tablespoon of added fat.
5013650~Hold the marinara! For a change of pace, dress ravioli with a quick and creamy sauce that gets added taste and texture from tiny pieces of string beans and prosciutto.
5008210~Tart rhubarb pairs with the sweetness of oranges to create a tangy sauce for roasted black sea bass. Cinnamon and ginger add a lovely background flavor.

5008242~The tangy sweetness of cherry tomatoes contrasts nicely with the plump, smoky chops, while green-olive paste gives a briny edge to the white beans.
5008243~A frosty glass of refreshing iced tea is the inspiration for this sorbet. Iced tea flavored with peaches has nearly outpaced tea with lemon in recent years. Bottles of tasty peach tea are available in most stores, but you can also brew your own with peach tea bags. If you use bottled tea in this recipe, make sure it isn't diet.
5008244~If you cannot get turkey breast already packed, buy a whole turkey and use the breasts for this dish and the thighs for Turkey Chili.

5008246~Ginger and cilantro add Southeast Asian oomph to this French-style butter sauce, which lightly coats big, meaty shrimp.
5008247~Cranberries are a rarity, even to this day, in Italy, so this crostata represents an achievement that's uniquely Italian-American. Though many crostatas employ jam, this one gets its zest from fresh cranberries cooked down and paired with an almond-scented crust—and the proportion of filling to crust is our idea of perfection.

5008252~Our fresh take on the classic Moroccan salad pairs shaved fennel and red onion with assorted beets and oranges for color contrast.
5008253~If you buy fresh game hens, ask the butcher to cut them in half for you. To halve frozen thawed game hens, first cut out the back bones using poultry shears, then cut hens in half.
5008254~Tortilla soup is all about contrasting textures, but its real success hinges on a fabulous broth—in this case, homemade chicken stock enriched with a cooked purée of chiles, tomatoes, onion, and garlic.
5011653~Tostones
5008256~This rich buttercream is lightened and brightened with the addition of lemon curd. The recipe yields enough buttercream to ice a 3-layer 9-inch round cake. For cupcakes, halve the recipe.
5008257~Highly recommended!
5008258~Gently pickling the shallots mellows them and also adds hints of sweetness and acidity. Tossing them with some earthy, quick-cooked kale makes for a pleasing contrast in flavors.
5008259~"If Schlesische Mohnrolle is my favorite thing to buy at Hutzelmann, our favorite bakery in Berlin, then Kranzkuchen is my husband’s. Max has a soft spot for Kranzkuchen, an almond-paste and rum-raisin–stuffed sweet wreath. He has tried many Kranzkuchen in his life, but he says that absolutely none come close to Hutzelmann’s version, sold in thick slabs all year long. It is glorious: sticky and rich, winey with rum and almond paste, chewy, and flaky all at once.
I tried many times to re-create their Kranz (which means “wreath”) at home and never quite got it right, but in the process I developed this recipe, which is pretty darn good. Forming the wreath requires a bit of moxie because once you roll up the almond-cream-filled dough and slice it lengthwise, you have to wrap the 2 strands around each other without allowing the filling to leak too much. After baking, when the Kranzkuchen is golden brown and shiny from the apricot glaze and topped with a drizzled glaze, it’s as beautiful as it is delicious. I suggest you bake this when you have a lot of people to feed at once—it’s best the day it is made."
5008260~Shakshuka means “all mixed up” in Hebrew and is one of the most popular breakfast dishes in Israel and at Sofra. Many countries in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean claim a version of their own, like Tunisian chakchouka, made with peppers and harissa, and a Moroccan version made with lamb sausage and harissa. The eggs are poached directly in the spicy tomato sauce, so it’s important that the sauce is well seasoned and warmed before you add the eggs.

5008271~Shrimp absorbs the flavors of a marinade rapidly, making this quick entrée ideal for a busy weeknight. Steaming gently cooks the shrimp and reduces the likelihood of overcooking. Regular coconut milk offers the best flavor for this dish, as the taste of light coconut milk is too subtle. I often serve it over brown rice or whole wheat noodles.

5008274~These balls will definitely get any party started. Buffalo's finest bar food minus the bones is the perfect food to serve for the big game, a surprising appetizer, or even passed as a fancy hors d'oeuvre. It's the best part of hot and spicy wings with none of the mess. If you like your balls extra spicy, you can always add an extra tablespoon or two of hot sauce to the recipe. Make one batch and you¿ll know why these are a staff fave and top seller at the Shop. Serve with Blue Cheese Dressing .

5008287~Start this early in the day or the night before. Chilling the chicken uncovered for several hours makes the skin crispy when roasted.
5008288~Making chipotle vinegar is about as difficult as making a cup of tea. It is a fantastic tool to have in your repertoire when you want to add acidity with smoke in one easy pour. Use it in your favorite salads or anywhere you want to add smokiness.
5012672~Few foods metamorphose as dramatically or alluringly as garlic when it is roasted. Hardly a savory recipe exists in which one could not imagine this substance. I always have these garlic preparations on hand.
5008290~Highly recommended!
5008291~The tamarind, a tropical shade tree native to India, also grows in Southeast Asia, Africa, Hawaii, Mexico, South America, and, of course, the Caribbean. Its long brown brittle bean-like pods each hold a sweet-sour sticky brown pulp containing up to ten seeds. Its flavor is akin to dates mixed with lemon and peaches.
5008292~The magnificence of a beautifully presented cooked whole fish is experienced far too infrequently today. Most people prefer the convenience of fillets, but fish has so much more flavor when cooked whole. Wrapping the fish in foil is a simple, effective way to lock in the juices.
5020067~The grill adds a sophisticated smoky quality to this dish, but you can make it from beginning to end using only the oven.

5008298~Cans of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce are available in the Mexican food section of most grocery stores. You'll need to puree some for this recipe.
5008299~The name Newman was once a staple only in Hollywood; today, it's a staple in kitchens all across the country. That is largely the result of the efforts of two people: Paul Newman, who founded the Newman's Own line of food products in 1982, and his daughter Nell, who expanded the brand with Newman's Own Organics 11 years later. All profits of both companies go to charities.
5008300~Cooking corn this way adds a depth of flavor from the husk and keeps the kernels from drying out. Tossed together with zucchini and scallions, these quesadillas make for a super-satisfying vegetarian dinner.

And being from a Greek family, I can say unequivocally that food is the center of our lives. The great thing about these home-style dishes is that they're generous to the cook and to everyone else: You don't have to be a pro to prepare them, there's always plenty to share, and you'll have a delicious meal on the table in no time."""
5008488~My husband taught me how to make Yorkshire puddings, and now I am hooked. I like to make them as individual puddings, baked in a non-stick muffin tin, but you can also make one large pudding in a high-sided pan and then cut it into portions. As a child, my dad used to eat them as a sweet dessert—you follow the same recipe, but finish off by pouring warm honey over the top. Comfort food at its best.
5008306~Sweet and sour is a recurring theme in Arabic cuisine. Pomegranate molasses has this distinct taste. Here I've mixed it with other flavors, but it can be used on its own to enhance a salad, a dip or a savory pastry. The pepperiness of the arugula and the soft buttery eggplant along with the sweet cherry tomatoes are unforgettable.

5008318~"These decadent silver dollar-style pancakes are inspired by the classic British banoffee pie but are completely free from refined sugars—and they're gluten-free to boot. Sticky and sweet dried dates are soaked in hot water and blended to create the luxurious toffee-like ""caramel."" If you're feeling extra indulgent, whip up a batch of Coconut Whipped Cream to go on top."
5008319~With the rise of the Italian and Portuguese populations in Rhode Island's fishing communities in the middle of the nineteenth century came the introduction of the tomato into traditional clam chowder. By the twentieth century, this new version came to be called Manhattan clam chowder (some historians say that it was also called Coney Island clam chowder and Fulton Market clam chowder). It is believed that disdainful New Englanders named the red-stained chowder after Manhattan because they believed New Yorkers were the only ones crazy enough to add tomato to a pristine white chowder.
5013427~This appetizer is traditionally made with friselle (ring-shaped rolls). Friselle are baked twice, giving the rolls a very crunchy texture. To soften the bread slightly, it's dipped in water and brushed with olive oil before serving. When Donatella was growing up, her family would put bowls of water and olive oil on the table with the friselle so that everyone could dip their own bread. If friselle aren't available, toasted ciabatta is an easier-to-find substitute.

5008349~By this point in the summer, the mint in most gardens has grown knee-high and is threatening to take over. Don't panic—harvest a few armloads and turn the bounty into a refreshing drink. Plan on making a couple of batches, both with and without alcohol: Adults will swoon over the smooth, bourbon-laced juleps; kids will enjoy the lightly sweetened herbal tea all on its own.
5008350~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

""choice"" grade, packer-trimmed brisket: That's a brisket with none of the fat cut off. Before being cooked, the meat is seasoned with a dry rub; during cooking, it is brushed regularly with a beer-based mop. You'll need to use a smoker for the brisket (a converted barbecue won’t maintain the very low heat required), and to get the most authentic Texas flavor, seek out the natural lump charcoal specified in the recipe; it's available at barbecue stores, some natural foods stores and some supermarkets."

5008418~There aren't many dishes more satisfying than a sizzling steak with a full complement of savory side dishes. Alex Rodriguez likes his sides tasty and free of unnecessary fat and calories. This slow-cooked confit (a French culinary term referring to an ingredient slowly cooked in its own juices) fits the bill, and leftovers can be refrigerated for the next day. Add some steamed spinach and oven-roasted sweet potatoes as a well-balanced complement to the steaks, and you've got a dinner that knocks it out of the park.

Provide each person with a little bowl of sauce, as well as the usual plate to make assembly easier."

5008428~Sprouting and frying the sunflower seeds completely transforms their flavor. But just using salted, roasted sunflower seeds would also work fine. This recipe is from Staplehouse, America's Best New Restaurant 2016.
5008429~In this gorgeous pie, blueberry meets its perfect match: lemon.
5008430~BOILING OR STEAMING bok choy often results in a watery, stringy vegetable. But grilling halved heads of bok choy slathered with miso butter leads to pure flavor. Be sure to keep the heat at medium so the paste can caramelize without burning. My first few attempts at grilling bok choy (I used Shanghai bok choy) resulted in charred leaves that were too crisp to enjoy. Now I separate the leaves from the stalks and use them raw in a salad that wilts under the heat of the grilled vegetable. Use white or yellow miso paste in this recipe. If you use a darker miso, know that it will be saltier. Make this side dish when you are already firing up the grill for the main course.

5008436~It's low-fat milk, not cream, that gives this delicious side dish its richness. Try it with poached, grilled or roasted salmon steaks.
5008437~"In his ""A Tuscan Son"" menu, Tony Oltranti serves Polenta with Franklin's Teleme as a smooth, soft base for his roast chicken. This recipe takes polenta in a different direction—cooked with sage, rosemary, and Parmigiano-Reggiano, the polenta is then cooled, cut into sticks, and broiled until the outer edges of the ""fries"" are golden and crisp, a fine contrast to the creamy interior. Serve them with a fried egg and a salad for a vegetarian lunch, or pair them with something saucy like chicken fricassee."
5008438~With bacon and lots of fresh herbs, this salad has a delicious balance of flavors. A warm baguette and a good Cabernet round out the menu.
5008439~Like the striped pops from the ice cream truck—without the artificial flavors and colors.

5008445~The recipe makes about 36 truffles; 12 are used for the tartlets. The extras can be kept frozen for other special occasions. Start this recipe the day before serving the tartlets.
5008446~Lady apples—a small, hard winter apple that's yellow with a reddish cheek—are often used decoratively but we love them for their flavor. They're widely available in markets this time of year. Said to be one of the oldest known apple varieties, they originated in the Forest of Api, France, during medieval times.
5008447~Kristine Subido, chef at Wave in Chicago, makes you forget about pasta.
5008448~A trilogy of apple—cider, cider vinegar, and ample chunks of Gala or Fuji— contributes sweet-tart goodness to this Germanic dish. It's a simple, straightforward celebration of fall.
5013856~Colcannon (Mashed Potatoes with Kale ) and steamed asparagus tossed with lemon juice strike the right note alongside this braised beef dish. Rhubarb pie from the bakery is our choice for dessert.
5008450~The genius of this pasta recipe is in the contrast of the textures and flavors. If spicy isn’t your thing, sub in any fresh sausage you like.

5008455~Yes, fish can be autumnal, too. Fresh wild mushrooms and fennel pollen are the key ingredients in this elegant dish.
5008456~This vegetarian sandwich has very little oil—but it's still plenty indulgent, thanks to two cheeses and the sweet grilled peppers. Make it in a panini press or pan, or on the barbecue.
5012017~Short-grain rice has an especially high starch content, which makes it sticky — and easy to press into a lettuce or nori wrapper.

5008471~This juice is a real energy boost, and it's great when you need a pick-me-up or when you need to fuel a workout. The fruit provides energy, while the beet increases endurance, and the celery and fennel push out toxins.
5008472~"Croutons can be tricky. The store-bought versions are often too large, too salty, and too garlicky. So I prefer to make my own. I usually make several batches of croutons and store them in a resealable plastic bag in the freezer so I'll have them on hand. They taste ""just-made"" for weeks."

5008475~In this simple recipe, salty, smoked ham is paired with sweet mango and onion. The fruit and vegetables are cooked alongside the ham in the covered roasting pan, leaving them meltingly tender.
5017655~If four people eat a mix of light and dark skinless meat, you'll have enough leftovers for two more meals. Bonus: Your oven does all but 10 minutes of the work.
5008477~This delicious variation on a side-dish classic is made with red potatoes and flavored with a full head of roasted garlic.

5008487~For such a rich fish, tuna is a good team player—it takes well to all kinds of seasoning. Here, I give it some tang by marinating it with lemon juice and zest, onions, capers, rosemary, and the most surprising ingredient: some of the juice from the caper jar. Have fun playing around with the herbs in the salad; just make sure not to toss them with the dressing until you're ready to serve—tender leaves wilt quickly.

5008489~To keep this dish colorful, be sure to layer the red tomatoes inside the yellow peppers and the yellow tomatoes inside the red peppers.
5008490~I first sampled a version of this light and lively salad as a meal at chef Yves Camdeborde's Le Comptoir in Paris's 6th arrondissement. Yves and I participated in the New York marathon in 2006, and I am sure that the strength gained from this protein-rich salad helped me make it to the finish line! This dish has it all: color (the red bits are lobster roe), crunch, and a light touch imparted by a dressing of yogurt and mustard.
5008491~Chicken broth is combined with oil to stir-fry the vegetables.
5008492~Passion fruit syrup can be difficult to find. We located a bottle by contacting a distributor, Fee Brothers. (Call 800-961-3337 or write to info@feebrothers.com) Because the syrup is hard to come by (and artificially flavored) we devised a substitute for it that was well received: a tablespoon of passion fruit sorbet (Häagen Dazs makes one) and a teaspoon of grenadine, per serving.

5008518~As important as it is to develop feel and instinct when making dough, there is a metric formula for making pasta all'uovo. The Bolognesi love them. For every 100 grams of flour, use 1 50–55 gram egg (net weight, i.e., without the shell), which corresponds to 1 USDA medium egg. Your kitchen scale is almost certainly bilingual, and it is much easier to use the metric system for this than fractions of ounces, but it works out to 1 3/4 to 2 ounces of egg for every 3 1/2 ounces of flour.

5010458~This Baja treat is well known to residents of Southern California, where fish tacos have been popular since their introduction in the 1980s. The crunch of coleslaw contrasts with tender fish, and the creamy dressing is spiked with the smoky heat of chipotle chiles.

5018979~This dessert honors two good friends of the tomato—basil and cheese. Garnishes of candied cherry tomatoes and fried basil make it extra-special.
5008531~Harosetha thick condiment of fruit, nuts, and winesymbolizes the mortar the Israelites used in Egypt. Robertss particular mix of almonds, pistachios, dates, and dried apricots, reflective of the Middle East, is outstanding (note that we prefer the sweet-tart complexity of California/Pacific apricots to the bland sweetness of Turkish ones). Enjoy leftover haroseth slathered on matzos or crackers; we discovered its great with Manchego cheese as well.
5008532~Thick asparagus spears become an addictive appetizer when they're given a crunchy coating.
5008533~Stir some chopped fresh mint into yogurt for a cool topping on sliced tomato and cucumber salad, with warm pita bread alongside. Pistachio ice cream on sweetened orange segments is perfect afterward.

A roll of this flavorful dough—chock-full of pistachios, cranberries, and oats—in the freezer or fridge is like money in the bank. Impromptu party? Friends drop by unexpectedly? No problem!

My father said it tasted just like his grandmother's, and I was very flattered. That's basically the story of how I started cooking. After almost a lifetime in the kitchen, I still enjoy playing around with recipes. I've even been known to go out to dinner, taste a certain dish, and then re-create it at home in a few tries."""
5008558~It doesn't get any cooler than halo-halo, the Filipino treat with a base of fluffy shaved ice. Macerating the fruit makes it extra juicy and saucy, but you could just throw in any unadulterated berry. The key to this dessert (as with any sundae) is a mix of textures: icy, creamy, chewy, crunchy.
5008559~Even though Aux Delices des Bois left Tribeca, Thierry and I still love Zutto, the sushi bar that was near our warehouse. It dates back to when Tribeca's cast-iron canopies cast their shadows on silent streets at night.

5013739~One of the most popular items on the Tanoreen menu, this tower of crispy pesto-marinated eggplant slices spread with smoky baba ghanouj, just might be the dish that inspired me to write this cookbook. It draws on the flavors of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, but the truth is, I created it to encourage my son to eat eggplant. He always loved fried zucchini sticks, so I cut eggplant in the same shape and he was none the wiser (although here they're cut in rounds). This is a good example of how I have taken advantage of ingredients that are available to me in the States and married them with the classic preparations from my childhood.

5008568~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5008569~"To many Southerners, green beans are ""snap beans"" because they ""snap"" when you break them. This recipe, my own, combines three southern favorites: green beans, mustard, and country ham. I like these beans best with roast turkey, grilled or roast chicken. But they're equally delicious with pork chops or roast pork. Some southern supermarkets sell biscuit slices, slim rounds of country ham ready to cook and slip into biscuits. Others sell country ham by the piece or the pound. If it's not available in your area, you can order it from thevirginiacompany.com. Note: Because of the saltiness of the ham, the mustard, and the broth, these beans are unlikely to need additional salt. But taste before serving and adjust as needed."
5008570~The roast can be prepped one day ahead. What to drink: A robust, medium- to full-bodied red, such as an Italian Barbera. Susan Simon also recommends a Carlo Hauner 1998 Rosso Antonello (made with Sangiovese and Nero d'Avolo grapes); it's produced on the Italian island of Salina.

5008577~Chefs do crazy things with nuts. In this otherwise straightforward chicken dish, cashews are transformed into a creamy sauce, and candied spiced walnuts are used as a crunchy topper.

5008591~Toasted coriander seeds and radishes give this salad — a twist on the classic frisée aux lardons — an appealing spiciness.

5013422~What is a country salad? In my mind it is a thoughtful blend of greens — Lola Rosa, frisée, red oak leaf, tatsoi, endive, mâche, arugula, and mizuna — combining different tastes and textures, topped with a ripe cheese and an artisanal cured ham, and garnished with seasonal fruit and vegetables. A well-balanced vinaigrette and spiced walnuts make it impossible to resist.

5014975~At Mesa Grill, this barbecue sauce is used as is, or as a base for some more complex sauces. The ancho and pasilla chile powders add Southwestern flavors to the traditional barbecue-sauce ingredients: tomatoes, onions, garlic, sweet molasses, and brown sugar.
5008638~Roasting turns a so-so tomato into something pretty tasty, but it makes a high-season beauty that much more amazing. Here, the tomatoes can be roasted ahead of time so you can avoid having your oven on during the afternoon heat.
5008639~Two favorite spring salads get combined into one easy, lower-fat version.

5008644~Update classic peach Melba, one of the most enduring creations of Escoffier, by swapping a dark, slightly salty caramel for the customary raspberry sauce. Ripe peaches are essential to the success of this elegant dessert.
5008645~Highly recommended!
5017994~"Here is a lovely seasonal dish that's fresh and delicate. Note that there is no raw fish in this recipe; the word sushi simply denotes that a dish features seasoned rice, which can be served with a variety of accompaniments, including raw seafood. This type of sushi is called chirashi-sushi (chirashi means ""scattered""), and the rice is mixed with asparagus, thin strips of carrot, and cooked shrimp."
5008647~Don't let the name fool you. This chicken is sweet from the honey, but it's also very spicy from a jalapeño chili and plenty of black pepper. Frosty lager beer and orzo salad are cooling accompaniments. The chicken needs to marinate for at least four hours, so begin preparing it ahead of time.
5014398~In Philippine cuisine, dark, fairly harsh soy sauce is favored, but it's often combined with sugar to create a syrupy dressing for vegetables. The added garlic gives this sweet and salty sauce a pleasant kick.

5008658~Burrata is a luscious Italian cheese made by mixing cream and unspun mozzarella curds together (for a texture similar to ricotta): the mixture is then inserted into the center of a ball of fresh mozzarella. It can be found in some supermarkets, at specialty foods shops, and at Italian markets. Substitute fresh mozzarella if you can't find burrata.
5008659~This side dish is equally good with steak, broiled fish, or seared lamb chops.
5017410~Mashed Yams and Apples and Fried Onion Rings are superb accompaniments.
5008661~This crowd-pleasing recipe was developed by Susan Baldassano, Director of Education at the Natural Gourmet Institute for Health and Culinary Arts in New York City. For moist, tender muffins, use finely ground yellow cornmeal, such as that made by Arrowhead Mills. You can replace the blueberries with an equal amount of cranberries and increase the sugar to 2 tablespoons, or replace the blueberries with 3/4 cup of raspberries.These muffins are delicious on their own, or try them warm with butter and jam. Cooled muffins can be wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to three days or frozen for up to three weeks. Thaw and reheat muffins in 350°F oven or microwave (unlike those made with wheat, gluten-free baked goods won't get tough in the microwave). See our related story for more information and sources for gluten-free ingredients.

5008672~Lemon juice is an integral part of this classic dish. Choose the smallest clams possible, and make sure not to overcook them.
5008673~In these margaritas, frozen watermelon takes the place of ice. Blending in the seeds gives the drinks a striking speckled appearance.
5008674~"Other seafood may be used in this dish, including scallops, tuna, swordfish, squid, or monkfish. Fish with a relatively firm texture, like that of snapper, is the best choice. Select fish that is perfectly fresh, since the fish is ""cooked"" only by the acidity of the lime juice. Serve avocado slices as an accompaniment, and garnish the plates or platter with additional sliced tomatoes and sprigs of cilantro."
5008675~This chicken takes about 10 minutes to pull together and then about a half hour of mostly hands-off time in the oven. In theory, you could time things so the chicken is ready as soon as the kids go to sleep. But if you can't for the life of you figure out a way to steal the few minutes needed for prep while the kids are awake, then just take care of step 1: Preheat the oven.
5017406~Salade de Laitue
5008677~The stock recipe yields 8 cups; there will be about 1 1/2 cups left over after you make the mushroom soup.
5008678~"Translated into English as ""the Goat Sucker,"" El Chupacabra is a mythical creature known for its nocturnal prowling and as the culprit in weird livestock deaths. There are various descriptions of the creature, which is believed to be heavy, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines stretching from head to tail. Maybe you've heard the silly stories. My fascination with this mythical creature inspired me to invent a drink as its namesake. This martini is infused with fiery red blood orange juice and the explosive Brazilian aphrodisiac açaí, making this an exotic bright red cocktail full of drama and flavor. Açaí juice is actually very healthy and has 33 times the antioxidant content of red wine grapes. Hints of guava and pineapple nectar in this drink are fruits from Puerto Rico (where Chupacabra sightings were first reported). The understated tones of coconut rum make this drink equally dangerous, so sip with caution."

5008685~Along with shrimp puffs and the ubiquitous nut-coated cheese ball, some version of these tasty bites was all the rage at 1950s cocktail parties. They haven't lost their allure—just some fat and calories—in this slimmed-down incarnation that swaps reduced-fat hot dogs and crispy leaves of phyllo for the traditional fat-laden cocktail sausages and crescent-roll dough.
5008686~A nice side dish for a casual picnic or for a fancier meal with grilled chicken or seafood.

5008697~Keys to great chips: A lower frying temp gets the moisture out; a vinegar soak ensures they're crisp.
5008698~"This is the stew that made such an impression on the final episode of the first season of Top Chef Masters. Each of us had been asked to create a meal that would be an autobiography told through the dishes we would present to the judges. I immediately thought of baeckeoffe (""baker's oven""). The name refers back to the time when bakers used wood-fired ovens. After the bread was done, this dish would be baked long and slow in the falling temperatures of the cooling oven. Since everyone in town would see the baker every day for the family's daily loaf, each would often bring a casserole to be baked in the oven. It was traditional, particularly on Mondays, when the women went to the river to do their laundry. They would have marinated their meats and vegetables overnight, dropped their casseroles off in the morning on their way, and then picked them upplus a loaf of breadon their way home. Even though my father was not the bread baker and had a modern, gasfired oven, people still took their casseroles to him. They liked to drop in because he always had some joke or story to tell. Before the village baker also invested in a modern oven and was still using wood, when my father turned over a fresh loaf of bread to give it the traditional blessing, he would sometimes see pieces of charcoal embedded in the crust. That would send my dad wild, muttering that ""he [the baker] did not thoroughly clean his oven!"""
5008699~A light, refreshing and tangy-sweet dessert.
5008700~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5008703~Here's a tangy condiment for holiday entrées; try it with pork tenderloin, roasted chicken or turkey. Begin preparing the relish a day ahead to allow the flavors time to blend.
5008704~Brisket is the centerpiece of many holiday tables, but pot roast, cooked to succulent tenderness in a full-bodied braising liquid brightened with the tang of wine and tomato and enriched with a heady trio of cinnamon, bay leaf, and thyme is just as special without sacrificing tradition.

5012506~It's important to make this tender fresh pasta into pansoti as soon as you have cut the dough into squares: The squares dry out quickly and become difficult to seal.
5008710~When food editor Lillian Chou was faced with creating a recipe to use up the scant cup of sour cream left over from our Ravioli with Green Beans and Prosciutto , she immediately thought of pancakes. She knew that the sour cream would act like buttermilk to produce a very tender texture. But the eureka moment came when she thought to combine some of the sour cream with maple syrup and butter for a topping. The result is the color of café au lait, with the tang of sour cream playing off the syrup's deep sweetness.
5008711~Yes, it's a long recipe with several parts, but each step is easy enough, and it can all be made ahead.
5008712~A warm, richly spiced oil turns a bowl of mixed olives into elegant party fare.
5008713~Toasted seeds and nuts add bite to this nutrition-packed salad. We use dried sprouted legumes, which are even more healthful than ordinary beans and more convenient than sprouting your own. (Cooked lentils and mung beans work well, too.) A vibrant chive vinaigrette brings it all together.
5008714~These good-for-you sandwiches are low in fat and meatless.

5012714~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016914~The truffle oil is not essential, but it's a nice indulgent touch. Since the oil's flavor dissipates with heat, add the oil to this first-course soup just before serving.

5019786~Miso soup is the main item in a Japanese breakfast and is usually eaten with rice, eggs, fish, and pickles. The soup is also served for lunch or dinner with more complex garnishes.
5008725~Watermelon in its solid state is so loaded with water and sugar that it is little more than a beverage waiting to be released from captivity. This tangy, refreshing drink is the fulfillment of that promise. The addition of a little vinegar does much to expand the aroma of the watermelon, which is barely perceptible when youre eating the fruit. Mint and watermelon are natural BFFs. If you were unaware of that relationship before tasting this recipe, afterward you will try never to serve a slice of watermelon without a mint sprig somewhere nearby.

5008738~Highly recommended!
5008739~Tomatoes are great for grilling. The searing heat caramelizes the tomato's natural sugars. Tomatoes readily absorb the flavors of herbs and other seasonings, and their shocking red color looks terrific on a plate along with grilled poultry, seafood, or beef. The tomatoes can be grilled on any sort of indoor grill—for that matter, you could also smoke them in a stove-top smoker.
5008740~A mix of pleasantly bitter and crisp-tender vegetables perfectly complements the Duck with Walnut Sherry Vinaigrette . Some of the nutty, sweet vinaigrette will inevitably end up on the vegetables, enhancing their flavor.
5008741~The tortilla strips need to dry overnight, so begin making this one day ahead.

5008756~Flips were originally hot drinks made with egg and a variety of liquors and wines. They were warmed up by means of a loggerhead, an iron tool with a long handle and bulbous end that could be heated and plunged, like a poker, into the drink. Today, however, flips are generally served cold. Historically, they have been most often served in the morning or at bedtime, because of their soothing character.

My Rose Beef Bites are delicate and also delicious, with beef and horseradish being lifelong friends. Spending a tiny amount of time to be sure the beef looks pretty makes these canapés stunning to behold.

5008768~First the turkey is soaked overnight in a brine to improve flavor and ensure moist meat. (Be sure to use a pot large enough to hold both the brine and the turkey.) The smokiness of the turkey is offset beautifully by the tangy, sweet glaze, which incorporates two quintessential Napa Valley ingredients: wine and mustard.
5011927~Tart and fiery, this classic bright-green salsa shows off the flavor of tomatillos and the lovable grassy sharpness of fresh unripe chiles. Serve it with anything that would benefit from lively contrast, such as Chopped Fried-Fish Tacos .
5008770~Garnish with whipped cream and chocolate shavings for a lovely presentation.
5008771~Unlike many store-bought granolas, this luxurious blend of oats, green pumpkin seeds, and exotic dried fruit is preservative-free and not overly sweet. Sprinkle it on yogurt, pancakes, or waffles—or simply enjoy eating it out of hand.
5008772~Highly recommended!
5008773~Our food editors find the texture of pineapple sherbet so much lighter and fluffier than that of other sherbets and sorbets — it practically has the weightlessness of granita. It provides a wonderful, tangy balance to the rich ambrosia cake and is delicious on its own, too.

5008780~"Edward Lee, executive chef and owner of 610 Magnolia, in Louisville, Kentucky, shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. Known for blending Southern and Asian flavors, Lee uses the leftover turkey carcass to make a stock infused with country ham, ginger, garlic, and daikon radish. The richly aromatic stock forms the broth for Lee's ramen bowl, which he fills with tofu, avocado, watercress, scallions, shiitake mushrooms, soft-boiled eggs, and leftover turkey meat. Freshly grated Parmesan is the final, unexpected garnish. ""It adds umami to the dish,"" says Lee, adding, ""it disappears into the broth and adds a depth and nuttiness."""
5014769~This recipe was created to accompany Ginger Cakes with Molten Chocolate Centers and Ginger Crème Anglaise.
5008782~One of the very best things about this stew is its practical nature: If you blanch the vegetables, boil the potatoes, and make the infused broth a day ahead, this dish takes only 15 minutes to cook.
5008783~Highly recommended!
5008784~"Sue Torres puts a creative spin on Mexican flavors at her Manhattan eatery, Sueños. According to Torres, many people overcook chicken breast because they're worried about salmonella. ""You're not killing bacteria, folks —you're killing flavor and moisture,"" she says. Because it is easy to overdo the heat with the lean white meat, it's worth using an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness (the thickest part of the breast should reach 165°F). What to pair with that perfectly cooked meat? Torres has an idea. ""Chicken works well with so many seasonings , but coriander gives it a tuxedo,"" she says ."
5008785~Unlike the topping on German chocolate cake, which is soft and gooey, the coconut-pecan crust on this cake-like brownie is baked, making it crisp.
5008786~Extra milk makes these potatoes silky-smooth, and truffle oil adds luxurious flavor.
5008787~"""Au gratin"" is a term that, in America, is usually associated with cheese. But the term may refer to any light but thorough topping of fine fresh or dry bread crumbs or even crushed cornflakes, cracker crumbs, or finely ground nuts on scalloped dishes or casseroles. These dishes, usually combinations of cooked shellfish, fish, meats, vegetables, or eggs, bound by a sauce and served in the dish in which they were cooked, are then browned in the oven or under the broiler to form a crisp golden crust. Set the casserole dish or baking dish on a piece of foil, shiny side down to deflect the heat, or just set it on a baking sheet."
5008788~Spontaneity is the key to this pasta salad; it's not something you can make ahead and chill. The main ingredients can be harvested from a backyard plot or balcony pot, or simply be a reward for your produce-shopping prowess at the farmers market.

5008814~This is probably the most famous lentil dish coming out of India—yellow lentils tempered with spices and the usual holy trinity of garlic, ginger and chile. It has always been a favorite of mine and it would grace our family dinner table at least once a week when I was growing up. There are lots of different recipes for flavoring the oil (tadka), so play around with your spice pantry and see what you come up with. If you don’t have half of these spices, then don’t worry; just add a tablespoon of your favorite spice paste and it will taste just as delicious.
5018747~"Mocha custards are the ""coffee"" part of this whimsical ""coffee and doughnuts"" dessert."
5008816~We love lemon, artichokes, and olives, so this dish just makes sense to us. We almost always leave the skin on our chicken thighs so we can render out some of the fat and crisp the skin to perfection. If you and your family enjoy Greek flavors as much as we do, then this stew will quickly become a favorite in your household.

5008835~Sichuan peppercorns are a wonderful ingredient to have on hand—they lend such an unusual fragrance and flavor to foods (and not just savory foods; check out chef Raquel Carena's Mocha Mousse with Sichuan Peppercorns). In China, cooks traditionally toast the peppercorns to release their aroma and then grind them together with salt. Juicy roast chicken liberally rubbed with this spice blend makes a universally appealing dish. Its flavor is warm and subtle—serve the extra spice blend on the side so guests can sprinkle more on if they want to.
5008836~We love the look of fluted mushrooms in this recipe. Fluting will add about 25 minutes to your preparation time.
5008837~Rich and decadent, these are a surefire way to please a crowd. Use mushrooms that are slightly larger than bite-size because they will shrink a little when cooked. The mushrooms can be prepared the day before and then baked prior to serving.
5008838~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5008839~Drained nonfat yogurt—rather than mayonnaise or sour cream—provides the creamy texture. Start making this dip a day ahead, and try it with apple or pear slices.

5008892~This large rustic tart has hints of anise, cinnamon and clove, spices that are also found in the noted honey cake of Burgundy, pain d'épice. The apples can be roasted one day ahead so that the tart can be baked early in the day on Christmas Eve.

5008904~This smooth pâté can be set up in small jars for a more festive presentation up to 2 days ahead. A simple wine jelly topping—optional, of course— serves as both a conversation starter and a tart-sweet counterpoint to the rich mousse.
5008905~When it comes right down to it, the simplest holiday cookie is, hands down, this sugar cookie. No rolling pin or sheets of wax paper are required. Just roll the dough into balls between your palms, then coat them with decorative coarse sugars. This is the perfect cookie for children starting out in the kitchen, by the way. They'll have loads of fun mixing up different colors of the sanding sugar, and messy kitchen aside, everyone will be happy when they sink their teeth into the first ones warm from the oven.

5008908~Mimosa in Los Angeles uses coconut milk in this version of a Breton classic.
5008909~I love a recipe like this, in which one familiar item (balsamic vinegar) combines with something else very familiar (in this case, the elements of a homemade barbecue sauce) to form something entirely new. The end result, which gets slathered all over spareribs that have been slow-roasted in the oven and baked at a high temperature until the two entities combine, makes for a sticky, tangy, unforgettable take on good old-fashioned ribs. If you're feeding a crowd, the oven is your best bet for that final step; if you have the time, though, try broiling the ribs with the glaze on top. The rib and the glaze fuse together and, if you take it far enough (just before it turns black), you get a crispy, sweet, and succulent rib that'll be your new standard from now on.
5008910~While the crispy, buttery lace cookies add addictive crunch to this dessert, they're not mandatory. The citrusy creaminess of this Italian-style lemon tart makes it an impressive finale all on its own.
5009428~If you make these as a side dish for the southern fried catfish, you can fry them in the same oil, but cook the hush puppies first because the fish will flavor the oil.

5008930~This is one of those recipes that will make you look like an incredible cook for very little effort. Because of skirt steak’s relatively loose grain, it soaks up marinade incredibly well and is one of the few meats we ever marinate before grilling.

5008933~These tiny birds, stuffed with creamy goat cheese, make fun yet elegant turkey stand-ins. Since the quail are small and there's not much meat on each one, plan on serving guests two to three per person, and encourage them to chew the meat off the bones rather than trying to cut it off with a knife and fork.
5008934~I first met Katy Sparks in the flesh at New York City's French Culinary Institute. We were both there to teach on a mentorship program, and since I was already wild about the food at her restaurant, Quilty's, I made a beeline for her and insisted we become friends and spend lots of time eating together. For fun, Katy and I have given several cooking classes working as a duet; she made these dates at our first class together. They are just the kind of thing I find irresistible — sweet, crunchy, juicy, spicy — you name it, they've got it. Once you have the ingredients, they're very easy to put together.
5008935~Here's the real thing — far more vividly colored, textured and flavored than the stuff that comes out of a can, and far more comforting. A drizzle of lemon-rosemary cream gives this classic American soup an Italian touch.

5008945~Highly recommended!
5008946~Faced with a cup of just-shucked peas, my mind runs in a million directions. Should I simmer them with soft butter lettuce leaves, pair them with pasta, or flatter their delicacy with new sage leaves and their blossoms, fresh mint, or lemon (or even all three)? Basil is lovely with peas, too. I could add them to that meager handful of fava beans that are waiting for company, or use them to make a frothy green soup. After scanning the possibilities, I end up cooking them with minced shallot, sage, and lemon, then spooning them over baked ricotta with crispy bread crumbs. This is one of my favorite dishes.
5018247~I use simple syrup for keeping cake layers extra moist. Plain simple syrup works perfectly well on its own, but when I have used vanilla bean pods on hand, I like to steep them into the syrup (feel free to keep them stored in the syrup indefinitely). It's an unnecessary step, for sure, but I always welcome a little extra pop of vanilla flavor in my cakes.

5008950~Here's a colorful and delicious addition to a brunch menu. It also makes a lovely light dessert on its own.
5008951~When coming up with a vinegar sauce for Fette Sau, I didn't want something that was too obviously connected to any specific regional barbecue. (North Carolina 'cue employs a sauce that's either vinegar and spices, in the eastern part of the state, or the same with the addition of tomato, in the west; South Carolina adds mustard to its vinegar sauce.) And I wanted a vinegar sauce that would work equally well with all kinds of smoked meat—not just the pork it's usually paired with. This sauce will add brightness to pulled pork, and it has enough depth to stand up to beef and lamb.
5008952~Instead of pork shoulder, this southern-inspired recipe uses quicker-cooking pork tenderloin. For fullest flavor, look for Berkshire pork or another heritage breed. Smoked salt in a grinder can be found in the spice section of most supermarkets.

In this recipe, the outside of the turkey is rubbed with bacon drippings so that the skin will be golden, crisp and delicious.
5008995~A mildly sweet and pungent dish. No soy sauce is used in the sauce, so it is lighter in color than other sweet and pungent dishes.

It's a funky, comfortable place in the East Village, with food that's hearty and innovative (and all vegan). Once, my younger son ordered the Green Garden Platter, described as ""seasonal mixed greens sautéed with grilled marinated seitan, garlic, and olive oil, topped with grilled carrot polenta in mushroom gravy."" I was intrigued by the combination of seitan and polenta, so when I got home, I made my own version, which bears little resemblance to the restaurant's. There's something enticing about seitan/polenta synergy, and with the addition of greens, the result is a great-looking, hearty dish."

5009013~Tuna, which is hearty enough to stand up to strong Spanish flavors, is particularly popular on the Iberian Peninsula. Dusted with paprika and served atop a sauce of tomatoes with bell peppers and ham, the kebabs make outstanding summertime eating. Pour a Spanish Rioja throughout, and present a caramel flan with berries to finish.
5014102~Pleasantly pungent with a touch of heat, this classic spring roll sauce also works well with the chicken satés.
5009015~Drummed up by our intrepid recipe tester Lauren Godfrey, this nontraditional taco, sweet with squash, earthy and nutty with kale, and crunchy with fried pumpkin seeds (pepitas), is—shhhhh—vegan. Don't tell anyone, but because it is so tasty, no one will care. The cashew crema can be replaced by store-bought crema or our Cumin-lime crema, but after polling both vegetarian and carnivorous friends, everyone preferred the nutty and rich nondairy cashew version (which must be made with raw cashews to work). To prepare the butternut squash, use a sharp peeler to remove the tough skin before slicing it in half and scooping out the seeds and fibers. Lazy cook's tip: Some markets sell butternut squash already peeled and seeded and ready to go.
5009016~Want to shake up your cookie platter? Simply make a notch in two of these lightly spiced sugar cookies, then interlock them to create an edible sculpture that also makes a beautiful tree ornament.
5009017~Blanched almonds go into a blender with water and oil and come out as a luscious aioli. Because the nuts aren't toasted, the sauce doesn't actually taste very nutty. It's more decadent than yogurt, more subtle than mayo.

5009020~"The French have a saying, ""You must watch what you're cooking like milk on the stove,"" referring, of course, to the fact that milk can boil over in a flash.

5009039~This rich, delicate cake forms the basis for many filled, frosted, and glazed cakes. A good plain gênoise is hard to beat—it has an elegance that derives from its simplicity, and I even like them unadorned. Many recipes for gênoise add butter as an enrichment. Unfortunately, sometimes the extra manipulation the incorporation of the butter necessitates causes these light batters to fall. So I prefer to add a few extra egg yolks instead—they not only help enrich the cake, they also provide greater stability to the foam, ultimately making the batter easier to prepare.

5009066~The Centre de Formation en Restauration Traditionnelle, a government-sponsored cooking school in Rabat, is dedicated to preserving the art of traditional Moroccan gastronomy. The students, all young women, will go on to staff Morocco's embassies and consulates around the world. This classic tagine recipe, given to me by the Centre's former director, Monsieur Tamer, is part of the school's delectable curriculum.
5009067~This recipe is a favorite of mine on a cold winter's night as it always reminds me of times with friends when we would ski and snowboard all day then sit by a log fire and eat and drink all night. If you don't have maple syrup on hand, use a spoonful of honey instead.
5009068~Sorenson uses locally made House Spirits coffee liqueur, made with Stumptown beans, in this cold-brew cocktail. It's delicious, but hard to find outside of Oregon. In its place, use any other coffee liqueur.
5009069~"""Last summer I attended an event at the Three Clock Inn in South Londonderry, Vermont. The chef prepared a lovely luncheon, and it included delicious crab cakes,"" Bill Brett of Bondville, Vermont. ""When I went home, I came up with my own version."""

5009071~Ground turkey would make a fine substitute for beef in these Southwest-style burgers (grill until cooked through).
5009072~This unusual Iranian stew is served hot at the table from the casserole in which it has been cooked. The lid is lifted, and the delicious aromas of rich tender lamb, fresh herbs, spinach and beans fill the room. Serve with rice or orzo.

5015190~Sweet and sour are two of the five flavors of classical Chinese cooking (along with salty, pungent, and bitter), and go lo yuk, as the dish is called, is a favorite way to prepare pork in Cantonese cooking. The recipe here has a lighter sauce more akin to the Cantonese version than the overly sweet goopiness of bad takeout versions, but it also has the crispy boneless pork that any lover of this dish will recognize. I prefer fresh pineapple, but if you like your dish sweeter, use canned pineapple and reserve some of the juice from the can to add to the sauce in place of fresh pineapple juice.
5009080~Marinating and searing the watermelon concentrates its flavor and primes it for this savory treatment.
5009081~If you can only find regular coconut milk, buy 2 cans and use the thick cream that's floating at the top. The coconut cream will caramelize during cooking, leaving sweet brown flecks in the rice.
5009082~I love the old-school sound of corn popping on the stovetop. I remember the very first time Ryder heard it—we were up at the cabin and he walked in to investigate what the heck was making all the noise. His eyes got as big as saucers when I showed him what was going on in the pot. There’s nothing like seeing stuff you usually take for granted through the fresh eyes of kids. Most kids today only know pre-popped or microwave popcorn. For more flavor and the much-deserved anticipation, there is nothing like the stovetop method. For best results use a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid and a good handle.
5009083~Highly recommended!
5011051~Though you can certainly buy preserved lemons, we prefer the rich, clean taste of homemade. This technique, adapted from Paula Wolfert's, brings a multidimensional freshness and a wonderfully distinct pungency to the lemons, which are as much a revelation in salads, soups, or even cocktails as they are alongside the grilled fish. There's no need to rinse them first, but do discard the pulp — only the rind is eaten with the grilled sardines.
5009085~Highly recommended!
5009086~Accompany this dish with a salad of baby lettuces and sliced sweet onion- such as Vidalia or Maui- and some seeded breadsticks. End with chocolate frozen yogurt drizzled with coffee liqueur or chocolate sauce.

5018458~This dough is easy to handle and will give you a crispy crust that's also tender.
5009091~This is fantastic with coleslaw and warm biscuits. What to drink: A not-too-oaky domestic Chardonnay or a white Burgundy, such as one from France's St.-Véran region.
5009092~"Twelve years ago, I made a simple bowl of ""strawberries pazzo""—pazzo means ""crazy"" in Italian — for my friend Ann Spivack (this book's co-writer). The combination of strawberries, balsamic vinegar, and black pepper has been part of my repertoire for decades. Ann thanked me by baking me this pazzo cake."
5009093~As a rule, every dough you make should contain salt—it complements the sweetness in your filling—and this buttery shortbread is no exception. Using salt in the crust and the filling helps create balance among the sweet, the bitter (from the lemon peel), and the acidic notes (from the fresh lemon juice).
5009094~These make-ahead packs are perfect for camping trips as well as quick and easy breakfasts on the go. Shredded potatoes and flavorful sausage are topped with baked eggs and spinach for a hearty morning meal.
5009095~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from < by Lauren Chattman.

5009098~Even if your crackers fail to puff, they'll still taste delicious.
5009099~Natural no-stir peanut butter is a special boon for those who like to bake with peanut butter. It's made without trans fats, yet stays smooth and doesn't separate, as most natural peanut butters do.
5009100~When steeped overnight in a grappa syrup, dried fruits plump up with juices that infuse a moist, cakey almond filling in a golden crust.
5009101~A perfect introduction to the allure of chiles, this Italian classic balances the cherry peppers' piquancy with roasted bell peppers, lemon, and parsley. It's a bright, summery dish that you'll hanker for all year long.
5020106~Egg whites give these quick, cheesy nibbles their exceptionally light texture. Bite-size portions make them the perfect mouth-popping accompaniment to an aperitif.

5009115~At Selamat Pagi, our Balinese restaurant, lime, ginger, and lemongrass are mainstay ingredients, appearing in many dishes. We were thinking about making a sorbet that reflected some of these ingredients and wondered what would happen if we threw all of them together. Our initial taste transported us back to the lush green hills of Bali, after which we were all too disappointed to find ourselves standing in our test kitchen. Along with lemon sorbet, this might be our go-to refreshment when we desperately need to cool off.
5013718~Also called pressed butter cookies, spritz are the perfect holiday cookie. They are simple to make with a cookie press, pretty to look at, and delicious to eat. This recipe makes about eight dozen. Yes, you read that right—eight dozen. And the cookies are quick to prepare and ideal for giving as gifts or bringing to cookie parties. You can serve the baked cookies plain or decorate them any number of ways. I like to slather melted chocolate between two cookies for an elegant sandwich cookie. It's also fun to drizzle melted chocolate over the tops. You can also sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar or decorate them with royal icing.
5009117~If your grill is already fired up, why not give it a quick brushing and throw dessert on there, too? A balanced tropical marinade brings depth to caramelized pineapple.
5009118~Use a V-slicer (a simple, inexpensive version of a mandoline available at cookware stores) for the paper-thin pear slices.
5009119~One butternut squash gets used in two ways—raw and roasted—in this fall weeknight dinner, while fish sauce, lime, and coconut add a touch of Southeast Asian flair.
5009120~Pastry chef Jennifer Jones of Topolobampo in Chicago shared this recipe as part of a Cinco de Mayo feature on Mexican desserts. Coffee liqueur adds incredible depth to Frontera Grill's legendary chocolate pecan pie, but if you prefer to skip the booze in the whipped cream, use an equivalent amount of pure vanilla extract or espresso instead. Jones prefers to serve this pie when it's warm and gooey, but warns that it's a little tricky to cut that way. Her solution is to cool the pie completely, cut it into slices, and then pop it back in the oven until it's just heated through.
5009121~Sometimes simplicity speaks volumes. Our lemon loaf recipe is very straightforward. We do not add poppy seeds, pecans, or any other extraneous ingredient. We really feel that the most important aspect of a lemon loaf is the zingy lemon flavor, and we accentuate it by using a combination of freshly squeezed lemon juice, freshly grated lemon zest, and a mildly sweet lemon syrup. The sour cream gives this loaf a subtle tang and a dense, moist crumb that cannot be achieved with yogurt. If you want to increase the lemony goodness of these cakes, add the simple glaze after the syrup has set and the cakes are cool. This loaf freezes extremely well, so you can double the recipe and make a few extra loaves.
5009122~Basil, cilantro, and red bell pepper bring a savory element to this fruit salad. This is a great dessert, but would be equally good for breakfast or brunch.

5009134~"Moroccans love fresh juices, and the combinations they make are eclectic and highly seasonal. This is one of my favorites. Although it is commonly prepared as a juice, it can also be a drinkable dessert, especially on warm summer days. I once had it as a ""salad"" served with a spoon in late fall in the eastern High Atlas. Oranges hadn't yet ripened, and instead the cook used small clementines from down the valley. Served before a communal platter of Berber Barley Couscous with Vegetables, the drink seemed closer to a light, sophisticated, vibrant green gazpacho than a rustic salad."

5009137~Looking for a classic turkey with some added depth of flavor? This is the one for you. The meat tastes of sage, rosemary, and thyme.
5010598~This recipe was created to accompany Chocolate Strawberry Orance Wedding Cake .
5013979~Cooking a large piece of salmon fillet couldnt be easier and helps ensure that the fish stays flaky and moist. The crushed caraway seeds in the glaze add a subtle twist to the classic honey and mustard combination, which really complements the full flavor of the salmon.
5009140~If this stuffing is to be baked inside the holiday turkey, reduce the amount of chicken broth to 2 1/4 cups.
5009141~Canned yams make this side dish a snap.
5009142~Traditional chowders all start off with a hearty soup base of onions and potatoes, and that makes a good soup just by itself. To this fragrant base you then add chunks of fish, or clams, or corn, or whatever else seems appropriate. (Note: You may leave out the pork and substitute another tablespoon of butter for sautéing the onions.)

5009146~The double-shake method is key to this cocktail’s texture. The first round is to break up the egg white; the second is to chill and froth the drink.
5009147~A long marinade in a mixture of Korean ingredients infuses these short ribs with spicy-sweet heat. Braising the ribs locks in the fiery, garlicky flavor and results in incredibly tender meat that pulls easily away from the bone.
5009148~Other tender herbs such as cilantro, dill, and/or tarragon can be used instead for this salsa verde recipe. Though the breadcrumbs don’t stay crisp, they give body and subtle crunch to the sauce.
5009149~To make this easy appetizer even easier, substitute store-bought roasted red bell peppers for the home-roasted ones.
5009150~"""When my ancestors left Spain and settled on the Greek island of Rhodes five hundred years ago,"" writes Rebecca Levy of Los Angeles, California, ""they brought with them their Sephardic culture. Likewise, when I fled Greece during World War II and eventually relocated to Los Angeles, I brought with me the traditions of my home.

5009162~Highly recommended!
5009163~Brining results in moist, tender meat. Be sure to use a large center-cut loin, which cooks more evenly than two smaller pieces tied together. Begin this recipe one day ahead. What to drink: A medium-bodied fruity red, such as Merlot, or a fruity white, such as Australian Sémillon.
5009164~My mother grew up in Bad Nauheim, Germany, where she helped her parents with their inn and restaurant called Die Krone (The Crown). When I was growing up, she cooked several traditional German dishes, but one of the most memorable for me was her recipe for sweet-and-sour red cabbage. Though I was a pretty picky eater, I adored the cabbage and loved how it colored the mashed potatoes my mother would always serve with it. Mom never wrote the recipe down for me, but I reached out to German relatives and re-created it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed taking the trip down memory lane. Grating the cabbage takes a while, so make sure to have some good tunes on!

They are definitely more delicate than the traditional version, but the flavors of apples and walnuts still hark back to their heftier ancestors. Most of the components of this recipe may be made ahead of time and the dessert assembled just prior to serving.
5009175~Make this crumbly cake a day ahead; the early risers will thank you.

5009185~Rasam, as prepared in most homes in Southern India, uses either tamarind or tomatoes as the base. It is a piquant broth poured over steaming hot rice. In our home—both in Kerala and America—rasam was a staple part of everyday meals. One night when I was a teenager, I was out to dinner with my brother Tom in New York City’s Little Italy and ate mussels cooked in a light tomato broth very reminiscent of rasam. I couldn’t wait to get home, buy fresh mussels, and cook them in rasam. This dish has made its rounds in my kitchens for close to three decades now. Make sure to have some fresh crusty bread to soak up the tomato-mussel broth.

That said, this is one of the joys of eating seasonally—anticipation and excitement at the start of the season, despair and overload at the end."
5009224~Spicy horseradish cream and malty Guinness mustard amp up the flavor of this home-corned beef. You might need to special-order the brisket from your butcher, and you'll have to start brining the meat eight days before you cook and serve it. The Insta Cure No. 1 is optional, but it's nice to use because it gives the meat its traditional pink color. Save the leftover corned beef and vegetables for the sandwiches and hash.

5009227~The sweet bread called for here was introduced to Hawaii by nineteenth-century Portuguese immigrants. The stuffing can also be cooked inside the turkey, provided the bird is roasted immediately after being stuffed. For more flavor, rub the turkey with a mixture of salt and pepper and two tablespoons each of sesame oil, orange juice and lime juice, and let it marinate overnight.
5009228~Haroseth, a symbolic seder food, alludes to the mortar that the Jews used to build the pyramids when enslaved by the Egyptian pharaoh. Though haroseth visually mimes the unappealing look of cement, its taste is actually a delicious combination of fresh or dried fruit, nuts, spices and wine. There are as many variations of haroseth as there are seder tables around the world, and all reflect a myriad of traditions. This recipe is inspired by my grandmother's simple grated apple, walnut, and cinnamon version, along with the flavors of my husband's Middle Eastern background.

5014037~"Beef brisket is the centerpiece of many Jewish holiday meals, particularly at Passover, and every family has their favorite way of preparing it. There are countless recipes out there, but how many do you need besides your grandmother's? At least one more: This one!
Why? Because the meat is slowly braised in Pinot Noir, and the cherry notes in the wine pair brilliantly with dried tart cherries, which plump up with winey beef juices to become little mini-pouches of flavor on their own. Add to that a bit of star anise, which perfumes the brisket and your home with an exotic and enticing hint of licorice. Season the mixture with the sweet-and-sour agrodolce dance of brown sugar and balsamic vinegar, and you have a brisket that is at once counterintuitively familiar and wonderfully different. Like all braised meats, brisket improves in flavor, and slices more easily, if made a day ahead and chilled (see Cooks' Notes)."
5009236~These newfangled burgers are stuffed with feta cheese. Pressing the center of the raw hamburger to form a slight indentation prevents the burger from puffing up in the center when cooking.

5009260~Fresh crab meat is so rich, fabulous, and sweet that, for this dip, I wanted to highlight the texture and flavor of the crab without masking it. Served bubbly hot with a crisply browned, lemon zestpanko topping, this dip will be a party favorite—easy to put together, quick to bake, and quick to disappear, too.
5009261~A baked potato, peas and sorbet are all you need with this entrée, but for a party, dress up the pork with cranberry relish, couscous studded with diced bell peppers and green beans, and a rich almond tart.
5016816~Skordalia is often made with mashed potatoes or bread soaked in water, but we feel the yogurt gives it more flavor. Skordalia is also good with grilled fish or chicken breasts.
5009263~Cheese balls were all the rage in the 1970s, an easy, tasty, fab party food for any occasion. What's old is now retro-chic—this lightened-up cheese ball seduces with the sweetness of dates, the savory bite of blue cheese, a hint of shallot, and a teasing whiff of lemon zest.
5009264~The basil-shallot butter is versatile: Try it tossed with pasta or on chicken or shrimp.
5009265~Despite many Asian ingredients in this dish, the end result only slightly reflects their presence. Rice and asparagus make good side dishes.

5013995~Sesame seed sauce is a popular condiment throughout the Middle East. It's especially prized in Israel, because Jewish dietary laws prohibit mixing meat and dairy products. Thus, the yogurt and cucumber or yogurt and mint sauce served with grilled lamb in Turkey and Lebanon would not be consumed by observant Jewish barbecue buffs in Israel. But tahini has the creaminess and tangy taste associated with yogurt.

5009280~Grilled corn is one of the easiest way to do summer right. Some recipes will have you soak the corn in salt water before grilling, but for husked corn, this actually works against plumpness. This recipe can be kerneled and served on top of a burger or eaten straight off the cob, dressed in cilantro and crumbled cotija cheese.

5012864~The earliest Mexican cuisine was vegetable-based, so in times past, before Spanish beef, chicken, and pork worked their way into every taco, there were no doubt plenty of satisfying vegetable taco recipes. Today most vegetables are consumed as salsas, in soups, or stuffed into quesadillas and empanadas, but there's no reason why a vegetable taco shouldn't be every bit as tasty and unusual as any other. This sumptuous vegetarian feast is based on the classic combination of roasted poblano chiles and mushrooms, with the addition of corn and mild-flavored, soft queso fresco. This taco is often favored by even the most committed carnivores. In other seasons, bits of diced cooked sweet potato, zucchini, chayote, squash blossoms, or golden winter squash would be welcome additions.
5009288~Herring is an essential part of Scandinavian cuisine and always has a place in the breakfast smorgasbord, along with other kinds of salted and pickled fish, breads, pastries, cheeses, cereals, eggs, and potatoes. (We admit that herring for breakfast may seem a little unusual to some people. But try it on a thick slice of buttered rye—you'll be quickly converted.)

5009290~Offer this with Herbed Eggplant as a first course. Icy-cold ouzo is the perfect aperitif for the meal.
5009291~Skip the wine—this salad is perfect with a Belgian ale. Saint Andréis a soft, ripened cheese much like Brie or Camembert. Either cheese would make a good substitute.
5009292~Brussels sprouts sautéed with bacon are good served alongside. Pour a Zinfandel, Syrah or Chardonnay during the meal.
5009293~These cookies are like bite-size Linzertortes. Instead of being cut into triangles as suggested below, the dough can be cut into whatever other shape is preferred.
5009294~Cylindrical cookie presses are a fast and convenient way to make uniform intricate shapes. If you prefer something other than a wreath-shaped cookie, change the disk of your press and decorate as desired with colored sugars, nuts, or dragées to create Christmas trees, snowflakes, or poinsettias.

5009324~Give everyday chicken cutlets a delicious lift with a tangy-savory combination of fresh tarragon and capers. If you don't have a spice mill, a coffee grinder works, too—just be sure to wipe it out before and after using.

5009328~Prosecco and jelly: two of my favourite things. And when combined with raspberries, they make a wickedly celebratory concoction. The reason for putting this in the freezer for the first half an hour is to help set the prosecco bubbles in the jelly. It also works very well with cava.

5009363~"Commonly made with minced beef or pork, this traditional Sichuan dish (literally, ""pocked-face lady's tofu,"" said to be named for the food vendor who came up with it) is all about the bean sauce, which infuses the bean curd with a deeply nuanced spiciness. We tested the recipe with several commercial brands (be sure to get one that says ""toban jiang""), and though they varied in flavor and texture, they all yielded great results. For sources for the Sichuan peppercorns, hot bean sauce, fermented black beans, and Asian chile powder."
5009364~"""Rundown"" (also called ""oiled down"" or ""oil dong"") is a classic stew served throughout the islands, often using saltfish or mackerel. Stories proliferate as to where the term comes from, but Jamaicans say ""cook it down"" when they mean to cook something for a long time."
5009365~You can also roast asparagus alongside. Toss the trimmed spears with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and place on a separate rimmed baking sheet.
5009366~There's no easier dessert than fresh fruit. But for something a little more spirited, we topped it with some store-bought lemon curd lightened with yogurt and flavored with crème de cassis. This simple dessert is a snap to prepare.

Here’s a twist on the classic that packs more flavor and far more nutrition with the powers of mustard greens and roasted red pepper. These are great for a snack or for lunch at work.
5009373~Slow-cooking dark leg meat results in incredibly tender, flavorful chicken. However, if you prefer white meat you can substitute bone-in chicken breasts. Placing the onions on the bottom of the slow cooker will ensure that they become silky soft as the chicken releases its juices, creating a heady sauce.

5009382~Highly recommended!
5009383~For a zippier, more refreshing cocktail (that's what summer drinks are about, right?), it's all in the wrist. Muddling extracts essential oils to deliver maximum herb impact. Tarragon flavors the boozy lemonade here, but basil makes an excellent sub. And while muddled mint is essential to a Mojito, you won't believe what it can add to a Margarita. Shake up a few and see.
5009384~Serve these with a couple of tall, cold beers.
5009385~Though they're a nod to the classic pairing of cooking greens with a ham hock, these gently bitter greens have several important differences: Because they are blanched rather than braised, they hold their intense color; bacon crumbled over the top, rather than cooked with the greens, retains its crispness; and smoky chipotle gives the dish an alluring heat.

Imagine a fudgy brownie—chocolatey, rich, ringing every bell—and then picture yourself dancing around your kitchen, exuberant with the knowledge that these babies are truly guilt-free, since (almost) all the sinfully sweet goodness is derived from bananas, applesauce, and cocoa powder. That’s something to get up for in the morning! And I’ll say what I want to say without saying it: Fiber never tasted so good.
5009393~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5009394~Chef Boulud prefers guinea hens for this recipe, but we found free-range chicken to be a worthy substitute.

5009398~Highly recommended!
5015351~Puréeing beet greens into pesto and tossing asparagus ribbons into fettuccine is a great way to incorporate healthy vegetables into pasta. A poached egg adds richness and protein to the dish. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, reserve the beets for the Beet Risotto and 4 ounces of asparagus for the Frittata with Fennel-Spiced Pork and Asparagus .
5009400~"""If gumbo is the national stew of Cajun country, burgoo is the stew of Kentucky,"" Ronni Lundy asserts in her book Shuck Beans, Stack Cakes, and Honest Fried Chicken. Because the stew is made in many different ways with a variety of ingredients, the ""Burgoo Song"" by Robert Myles claims, ""You can toss in almost anything that ever walked or flew."" Many early recipes for burgoo include squirrel in addition to chicken, beef, and pork. In Kentucky, Anderson County, which hosts its Burgoo Festival every September, is known as the burgoo capital of the world. Arenzville, Illinois, makes a similar claim. But the French lay claim to the basic concept of burgoo, and it's conceivable that the word burgoo arose somehow from the French ragout (pronounced ra-goo), also a term describing a stew."

And with Hanukkah being a particularly kid-friendly holiday, we know children and adults alike will get a big kick out of the edible potato ""scales"" that top these individual slabs of salmon. Your budding young chefs will love arranging the scales on the fish."

5009430~Thailand has been heavily influenced by Indian culture. India's religion, music, and especially their food have all become part of Thailand's heritage. Curries are often thought of as an Indian thing, but Thai versions of curry are just divine. Serve this dish with Tom Yum , if desired.
5009612~Margaritas, crisp Mexican beer or sangria would be perfect with this dinner.
5009432~In Austria, warming bowls of goulash soup are served in all kinds of establishments — from quick-service restaurants along the Autobahn to Vienna's elegant Hotel Bristol. This hearty beef and vegetable soup can be found in many areas of central and eastern Europe, especially in regions that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Our satisfying rendition has chunks of beef and potato plus red peppers, bacon, onions, and garlic, all fragrant with paprika.
5009433~For a vegetarian version, use 24 ounces extra-firm tofu instead of chicken, and increase the soy sauce to 2/3 cup and the vinegar to 1/2 cup. Serve with brown rice or soba noodles.

5009454~"The Middle Eastern tone is part of this cake's appeal. A very nutty cake is suffused with a honey-citrus soaking syrup, much like baklava in concept but flour-free, making it suitable for Passover. A little goes a long way. For large Seder crowds, you can double the recipe and bake it in a 9-inch springform pan or a 9 by 13-inch rectangular pan. I serve this cake cut into small squares or diamonds placed in small muffin liner cups. Copeland Marks, in his book Sephardic Cooking, attributes this to Turkish cuisine. Joan Nathan calls it ""Tishpishiti"" in her book, Jewish Cooking in America and points to Syrian, as well as Turkish roots as does Claudia Roden in her book, Mediterranean Cookery. A nutty classic indeed! My version is inspired by a recipe simply called ""Nut Cake,"" found in From My Grandmother's Kitchen, by Viviane Alcheck Miner with Linda Krinn. If you are interested in Sephardic recipes along with a very engaging family history, this book is a real find."

5009484~Roasted eggplant spreads and salads come in many variations throughout Greece and are usually embellished with local flavor. In the North, yogurt is often added to the eggplants, for example, throughout the Cyclades, it is the ubiquitous caper and tomato that season this delicious dish.
5009485~"Jerry Traunfeld, author of The Herbfarm Cookbook (Scribner), says, ""Vegetables that are very fresh and picked at the perfect time are delicious cooked very simply. Just boil or steam them and serve with a little butter and maybe a sprinkling of tarragon, chervil or basil."" Or savory, or oregano, as in this recipe."
5009486~Highly recommended!
5009487~Bone-in cuts (like this pork loin roast) require a longer cooking time, but the payoff is big flavor and succulent meat. The meat closest to the bone is always the juiciest, and bone marrow enriches the sauce as the roast cooks.
5009488~Tip: Just-as-sweet calorie saver: Mix honey, not sugar, intro fruit desserts.
5009489~"These ""hats"" are a classic dish in Ferrara, where you'll find them filled with a range of different things, from meat to vegetables.

5012333~Traditionally, Indian cooking calls for ghee, a kind of clarified butter for which the milk solids are browned. Here's a simpler approach: Use straight clarified butter; the milk solids are removed so the butter doesn't burn as easily. This can be made at least a week ahead.
5009495~You'll find fresh rice noodles in well-stocked Asian markets (or search for them on amazon.com).

5009498~In Hong Kong, where XO sauce was invented, dried shrimp or scallops and Chinese ham are combined with chiles to create a powerhouse condiment that is salty, spicy, and funky. This recipe uses mushrooms in place of the pork, a cheeky reference to green bean casseroles.

5009501~"Throughout Abraham Lincoln's political career, his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, would periodically bake for him the Todd family's favorite cake, based on a recipe dating back to 1825. On first tasting it, Lincoln is reported to have said that this white almond cake was the ""best I ever ate.""

5009503~Highly recommended!

5009509~Jose Bengoa, Yolanda Bolivar, and Gabriel Antunez, the BBQ Freaks of San Juan, Puerto Rico developed this easy method for infusing a sweet clove and nutmeg accent into your next back of pork chops. Finished with a tamarind glaze, these chops will likely be unlike any your guests have tried before. You can buy tamarind pulp at health food stores and in Asian, Hispanic, and Indian food stores. We advise throwing in a few extra chops for guests who will want seconds. For a variation, try grilling the brined chops over charcoal or gas, followed by smoking at 250°F for 25 to 30 minutes.
5009510~A nice accompaniment to Blackberry and Apricot Compote.

5009524~The rich chowder serves as a sauce in this dish. At the restaurant, they use house-smoked king clams and panko in the panzanella, which is a modern take on the classic Italian bread salad.

5009526~Highly recommended!
5009527~These individual Pavlovas are inspired by the popular Australian dessert (named for the Russian ballerina), which combines crisp meringue with whipped cream and assorted fruit. It's easy to form the cups with a pastry bag, but if you don't have one, try this technique: Drop the meringue by half-cupfuls onto the baking sheets, then use the back of a spoon to create a deep, wide indentation in the center of each.

5009531~A sweet-savory sauce that's great with the grilled meats. Adjust the heat by adding hot pepper sauce to taste.
5009532~Coleslaw on the grill? Absolutely. It makes the cabbage and green onions tender and adds just a bit of smoky flavor.

5009534~Highly recommended!
5009535~Brining these pork chops for 2 days results in succulent, tender meat. The brine in this recipe is based on one that appears in Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton's Food of Campanile.
5009536~This Asian-inspired dish incorporates two essential condiments: hot chile paste and fish sauce. The chile paste gives the pork a great kick, while the salty, pungent fish sauce brings out the umami in the Brussels sprouts. If you've never tried fish sauce, never fear. Just like Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce is a wonderful way to add depth of flavor to a dish (and you can find it in the Asian section of most supermarkets). The funkiness will vary from brand to brand, so taste as you go.
5009537~Highly recommended!
5009538~A cool treat inspired by spumoni, the classic Italian frozen dessert of ice cream, whipped cream, rum, nuts, and candied fruit.

5009540~A mountain of skinny, crisp fries adds drama to the plate. Unlike thick-cut fries, which are traditionally fried twice (first to cook them through and then to crisp them), shoestrings are fried only once. And like potato chips, they taste great at any temperature.

5009551~In this creamy, risotto-like side, arborio rice is replaced with healthier whole-grain farro.
5009552~The exotic flavors of passion fruit and guava are layered in these pretty ice pops. To create perfectly defined layers, chill the guava mixture while the passion fruit mixture is freezing.

5009557~An excellent complement to roast pork.
5009558~"Sabrina Henderson of Gardena, California, writes: ""My love of cooking dates back to my junior-high home economics class. After that I took home ec every year I could.

5015137~Editor's note: Use this recipe to make Black Rice with Squid .
5009564~This recipe is a classic case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, especially when prepared and eaten outdoors, in warm weather, with bread and unconscionable quantities of Italian or Spanish rosé, ideally in Sardinia or at least with Sardinians. Female lobsters, with their delicious red roe, are a must. Ask your fishmonger, or look for animals with broad tails and soft, translucent feelers that cross at the tips.

5009567~Like most Francophiles, when we are not traveling to French-speaking (and -eating) destinations, we are at home, dreaming of them and inspired by them as we cook the foods we love. Steak frites is the definitive French bistro dish; our portobello version features a juicy red wine reduction that sings with tarragon and a touch of Dijon. You can easily make restaurant-crisp fries at home with the Vedge method: start with baked potatoes, then crisp them up in a little oil.

5009571~By the seventies, Julia Child, through her books and television shows, had made French food accessible, and the Cuisinart, introduced in 1973, made many of the cuisine’s more complicated techniques quick and simple. As a result, pâté became increasingly popular, and remains so today.
5009572~Serve this over a bed of soft polenta for catching the juices, with a simply dressed salad on the side.
5010086~This highly addictive stir-fried chicken continues to be one of the most popular Chinese dishes in America as the succulent, complex sauce of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy flavors is hard to pass up. For years Americanized versions often left out the Sichuan peppercorns because of an import ban, but now Sichuan peppercorns are once again easily found in Chinatown shops and even gourmet chains such as Whole Foods.

5009588~You can use small manila clams or cherrystones if you can't get cockles. You can also use mussels, but the cooking time will be slightly shorter.
5015449~In South Louisiana, any sauce is called gravy. This dish would be our equivalent of biscuits and sausage gravy, except we've got all this seafood down here that finds its way into nearly everything. Serve this gravy over biscuits ) with Oeufs au Plat , and you've really got something. As a chef, I make this a bit more complicated than it needs to be: I start with the shrimp in the pan, then remove them so they don't overcook, and then I add them back once it's all come together.
5009590~This recipe is an accompaniment for Kaffir Lime Mousse with Honeydew Water .
5013040~"The eight days of Hanukkah, the Jewish celebration of lights, honor the sacred lamp in the Holy Temple, which burned for eight days even though it only contained enough oil for one. Traditionally, many Hanukkah foods celebrate the oil in addition to the light. One of the most common is the jelly doughnut, known as sufganiyah. The word derives from the Hebrew word for ""sponge,"" an apt description for the texture of the doughnuts. I think they are more accurately ""pillowy."""

5009598~This crackers recipe features a variety of seeds, and the combination of colors and textures is impressive, but you can use fewer types—just make sure total volume stays the same.

5010073~Once you've charred them, you can drizzle these eggplants with your best extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with some coarse salt for a simple side.

5009611~When I was first served corn ice cream, I thought the guy who made it was having a laugh. To me, corn meant succotash, soup, and steamy ears buttered and sprinkled with crunchy sea salt. It did not mean dessert. Yet while it took me a good minute to get my head around the idea, it took me only about half a second to eat every last bit. Of course, corn ice cream makes perfect sense—corn is good mates with dairy; and during summer, the veg is sweeter than strawberries, peaches, and other fruits commonly spotted in ice cream. A healthy drizzle of butterscotch and a scattering of caramel popcorn add sweet–salty complexity and crunch.
5009612~Sopa de Tortilla
5009613~Look for Gold or Strawberry papayas. Their sweet flavor complements this tangy crab salad beautifully.
5009614~Many dessert menus include a colorful sorbet plate-light and refreshing after a rich meal. Offer elegant cookies alongside. For the pink grapefruit sorbet recipe, we prefer Essencia, a dessert wine with the unique flavor of orange muscat grapes. It's made by Quady Vineyards in central California. If you cannot find it, use a Sauternes or a late-harvest Riesling.

5009622~Highly recommended!
5012745~At the thought of Morocco, the mind tends to wander to the teeming heart of Marrakech; but the windswept coastal city of Essaouira, with its whitewashed buildings and heaping displays of glimmering fish (which you can have grilled on the spot), offers another sort of paradise. We can't supply Essaouira's particular perfume of sea and smoke, but the simplicity and clean flavors of this lemon-infused dish will take you there in spirit.
5009624~You can replace the pecans with just about any nut — such as pine nuts, almonds or cashews — and get an equally delicious result, or use a variety for a more interesting dessert. Some dough will be left over, so you can bake a few cookies alongside the tart.

The pay off: Super-roasty flavor."
5009633~A whole head of roasted garlic lays the foundation for an eggplant spread that's silky and satisfying, while chopped sun-dried tomatoes, fresh parsley, basil, and lemon add a healthy dose of sunshine, brightening its flavor and color. Serve it with thin slices of toasted baguette for a great take on crostini.
5009634~"Steve Silverman of South Burlington, Vermont, writes: ""In my cooking I tend to be very quick and health-conscious.

5009668~There is no dessert course in a traditional Japanese meal. Instead, pickles that refresh the palate are often the last thing eaten.
5009669~Sandwiching meaty black sea bass fillets together with an aromatic filling of red onion and fresh oregano perfumes the fish as it roasts. It tastes—and looks—wonderful topped with a colorful salad of small tomatoes, olives, and more oregano. The peppery, lemony herb, native to the Mediterranean, is a natural with fish.

5009674~Chicama is one of Manhattan's hottest Nuevo Latino restaurants. Chef Douglas Rodriguez — a pioneer of this style of cooking — oversees the open kitchen with its Ecuadoran eucalyptus-wood-burning oven and rotisserie. Rodriguez turns out dishes like adobo-rubbed Argentine rib-eye steak and black paella, which gets its unique color and taste from squid ink; there is also a large, innovative ceviche bar. To wash it all down, diners choose from the wines of Chile, Argentina and Spain — or from cocktails like the restaurant's namesake Chicama Colada.
5009675~Selling skeptics on the idea of a vegetarian dinner is easy when it's in pie form. Maitake mushrooms add heft.
5009676~Some say using a blender rather than a food processor results in a smoother puree. When combining pesto with pasta, Ligurians mix a small ladle of the cooking water into the pesto just before adding the noodles; this dilutes the concentrated sauce and helps it adhere to the pasta.
5009677~Rich with chocolate and dried apricots, this dessert is a stately yeast-risen cake that requires no kneading and very little attention. When you set it aside in a warm place, it does much of the work by itself. A large bundt or angel food pan can replace the traditional ornate mold.
5009678~Highly recommended!
5009679~This recipe gives you yet another excuse to keep a package of puff pastry in the freezer. If you prefer, swap out the marinated artichoke hearts for drained canned or thawed frozen artichoke hearts.

5009683~When it comes to ice cream cakes, there are no hard-and-fast rules as to what form they can take. Some consist solely of ice cream molded and then decorated to resemble a cake, while others intersperse layers of ice cream with thin layers of cake, crisp meringue, or even crumbled cookies. Our red, white, and blue July 4th extravaganza is a gorgeous amalgam of ice cream, cake, and blueberries and raspberries cooked separately into their own jammy fillings. Frosted simply in sweetened whipped cream and topped with more berries, this cake sparkles as much as the fireworks in the sky!

5009704~Start preparing this elegant layered treat at least one day before you plan to serve it.
5009705~Use these in salads (croutons in every bite!), sprinkle over pastas, dust atop tender braised meats, or just eat them out of hand (naturally).
5009706~This is terrific on grilled baguette slices, sprinkled with feta or fresh goat cheese. Or try it as a topping for grilled fish or chicken.
5009707~Highly recommended!
5009708~The oats in this salad are a distant cousin of the familiar breakfast staple oatmeal. As whole grain, oats have a wonderful, slightly chewy texture and nutty flavor.
5009709~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5009710~Highly recommended!
5009711~Before a revolution breaks out, we want to assure you that we still think real fried chicken—soaked in buttermilk and fried in peanut oil until its crispy—is the gold standard. But there's no denying that in the past 20 years two factors have had a huge influence on how we cook: speed and healthfulness. Oven-baked chicken satisfies on both counts, offering a crispy, tasty coating and moist meat with less fat and fewer calories. Plus, it's quick enough to make on a Tuesday night. Add a light, bright arugula salad and youve got dinner.
5009712~Rajas (strips) of crisp corn tortillas and sweet mini bell peppers make a colorful garnish.
5019223~Roasted whole garlic got its start at Chez Panisse. Here, it’s added to the decade’s ultimate comfort food, smooth and creamy mashed potatoes.

5011138~This can be completely assembled up to eight hours ahead, and then it requires only a short time in the oven.
5009719~Crème fraîche or sour cream gives the scrambled eggs a rich, creamy texture. Toasted breadcrumbs and a grating of cheese are delicious finishing touches.

5009722~The ice-cream balls are a perfect dessert for small groups.
5019204~Brussels sprouts were not part of the Palestinian kitchen when I was growing up. I discovered them here in the States and very eagerly tried to push them on my children. To that end, I did what any good mother would do—I pumped up their flavor by adding a little tahini sauce and sweet pomegranate molasses. It worked! In fact these Brussels sprouts were so delicious that they made it onto the original Tanoreen menu and I've never taken them off.
5009724~Radishes and breadcrumbs give this greens-packed vegetarian pasta its crunchy texture.

5009727~Look to Mexico, where turkey has been the big bird for centuries. Continue the theme by using the leftovers for tacos (corn tortillas, shredded meat, lime…). We promise you won't miss your sandwich.
5009728~This sugar, used in the cookies and lime ice, is great to have on hand for sprinkling on cut fruit or to add a boost to iced tea.
5009729~When it comes to dessert, I am a chocoholic first and fruit-pie lover second; but after several test batches to perfect this cake, I am completely won over, and so is everyone who has tasted it. This is simply a spectacular cake—moist and light with spiced pumpkin flavor and sweet bites of coconut and pineapple. In addition, it is a snap to make. It requires two 9-inch cake pans to make the layers, but the cake itself can be mixed together with a rubber spatula and bowl. If all the cake ingredients are pre-measured and the cake pans prepared, this can be a fun kitchen project to do with children, especially since it can be made ahead and frozen.
5009730~Fennel seeds, balsamic vinegar, roasted peppers, and caramelized onions really rev up this easy side dish.
5009731~Highly recommended!
5009732~Elegant but easy, this fast fish dinner is simple enough to prepare on a weeknight and special enough to serve to company.

5009752~We tried making this oil with Sichuan peppercorns that were not ground but found eating them whole just too numbing. Like the red-chile oil above, it's the perfect thing for adding a final blitz of flavor.
5009753~Highly recommended!
5009754~Cinnamon sticks are made from long pieces of bark from various laurel trees that are rolled, pressed and dried. The type of cinnamon used in Thailand is from the Cassia tree. Cinnamon has a sweet, woody fragrance in both ground and stick forms. Rich in therapeutic essential oils, cinnamon warms the body and enhances digestion. It boosts metabolism and is thus useful for weight loss. It is also good for diabetes as it stimulates insulin production.
5009755~While the restaurant serves the ultra-spicy salsa alongside hummus, tsatsiki, and baba ghanouj, chef Eric Leyden suggests it as a lively accompaniment to meats and hearty lentil or tomato soups.
5009756~Japanese eggplants have thin skins and few seeds, just meaty, flavorful flesh that transforms into tender, creamy textured, fragrant, smoky goodness when grilled. The classic way to enjoy this dish is with just soy sauce or Ponzu and a mound of katsuobushi, dried shaved bonito flakes (a type of tuna). The dressing below is more contemporary but also fantastic. Either way, get your hands on these eggplants and grill them.

5009764~Indulge yourself even more by mixing some toasted coconut (the sweetened, shredded kind) and a dash of coconut extract into vanilla ice cream, and scooping it alongside.
5009765~For the best results, these tender ribs need to marinate for at least 12 hours, so plan ahead. Offer a selection of bottled ales and lagers.
5009766~Juicy, crunchy cucumbers lighten the starch in a rice salad, and lemony coriander accentuates the citrus in the vinaigrette. So-called Persian cukes seem especially beautiful against a background of exotic purple jasmine rice. This is a party dish for which, no doubt, you will become justly famous.
5009767~This lamb-rich, Uzbek-style pilaf is typical of the fare served by northern Afghans to mark festive occasions. Despite the absence of spices and herbs, it is a surprisingly complex dish.
5009768~Lightly salting a center-cut tenderloin, a.k.a. chateaubriand, overnight allows the salt to penetrate this luxurious roast and keep it extra-flavorful and juicy.
5011542~Highly recommended!
5009770~Pork chops can get pretty dried out. This recipe fixes that age-old problem. It's also a great main course for a family-style dinner. Just slice the pork after it's done cooking, place in a serving dish, and then top with the savory mustard sauce. These pork chops make wonderful leftovers and serve as a nice addition to a breakfast or atop a salad for lunch. Perfect Pork Chops also depend on getting the right pork. Pasture-raised pork will contain a healthier mix of fats and vitamin D. Pork also contains high concentrations of thiamine, which is used by all cells to make energy and is particularly important to the brain, and B6, which helps make several key neurotransmitters.
5009771~We make this super-easy, super-tasty dish all year long. The bold combination of soy sauce, balsamic, and maple syrup works its magic on the meat quickly, so it only needs to marinate for as long as it takes to get your grill fired up. In the fall and winter, we pair this steak with maple-sweetened butternut squash. Come summer, it's a natural with a tomato salad and corn on the cob.
5009772~Two layers of tender orange sponge cake are embellished with a rich orange and honey chocolate glaze. Any leftover chocolate glaze can be chilled, rolled into small rounds and kept refrigerated to serve as truffles with coffee or tea.
5009773~I adore lychee juice, which tastes very much like the fresh fruit. You can buy aseptic packages of the juice in Asian markets, and I've seen them in many supermarkets. This sorbet is not only delicious, it's fun.

5009792~This recipe was created to accompany Mocha Mousse with Kumquat Cranberry Sauce and Phyllo Crisps .
5009793~"Arguably, some of the best ‘cue in the country can be found in North Carolina, where two distinct types of slow-cooked
pig prevail. The first is Eastern barbecue, which is distinguished by slow-cooking a whole hog and including
both the white and dark meat in chopped sandwiches and platters. Eastern ‘cue boasts just a hint of vinegar and
red pepper, which is added to the meat mix rather than used as a sauce. Western North Carolina ‘cue (aka Lexington-style)
is made from pork shoulder only. In addition to incorporating plenty of vinegar, sugar, and spices, it also mixes
in a good amount of ketchup to create an actual sauce for the pork. This slow-cooker recipe falls somewhere in between.
If you like, you can skip the sauce altogether and enjoy a basic roasted pork, which is not only fantastic on
a bun with slaw and hot sauce, but is great for making burritos, barbecue pizza, or nachos.
I recommend using a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker for this recipe in order to comfortably fit the pork shoulder. You can
also cut this recipe in half and use a smaller slow cooker."

5009799~Though widely accepted as the national dish of the Philippines, no two adobos are the same. This one calls for an unapologetic amount of turmeric, which has a somewhat bitter, definitely earthy flavor, and those deep, dark notes are backed up by charred coconut. This recipe is from Bad Saint, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.

5009815~Brining the turkey in the refrigerator for two days ensures an incredibly moist result. We do not recommend stuffing brined turkeys because the brine can make the stuffing too salty. A do-ahead gravy base eliminates last-minute stirring and thickening. Look for fresh bay leaves in the produce section.
5009816~This vinaigrette is delicious as is, though it can serve as a base as well. Add minced shallot or garlic, minced fresh herbs, lemon zest and juice, cracked black pepper. Use it with grated carrots or beets, fresh tomatoes, or any other vegetable mixture.

5011327~"If there is any ""magic"" to our cooking, it's in seasoning mixes such as this. With this mixture, we try to unmask the depth of flavor in our native seafood, not overpower it. We want every bite to display a full flavor profile, so we liberally sprinkle seasoning on the entire piece of fish. That means both sides. Make a decent-sized batch of this mixture so it will always be handy, then rub it or sprinkle it on the food. Remember, mixtures such as this cost very little to make yourself but quite a lot if you buy them at retail."

5009821~Oysters were very much a part of American life in Colonial days, and were cooked in every conceivable manner — boiled, scalloped or steamed; turned into pies and fritters; or, in the winter in Savannah, roasted over an open fire.

5009827~Green papaya salad in all its regional variations - often flavored with pork, beef, or shrimp (as below)-is hugely popular throughout Southeast Asia. The dish is made from unripe Southeast Asian papayas, which have firm white flesh and white seeds. The current popularity of Vietnamese and Thai food in the United States has increased these papayas' availability, although it is still generally limited to Asian markets. Such papayas can grow to the size of cantaloupes or larger and range in shape from oval to round. Look for rock-hard dark green fruit without a trace of pink or yellow blush. If you don't see any, ask (some shopkeepers do not display them).
5009828~Pork tenderloin makes a delicious replacement for veal in this dish. Rice and chutney complete the meal.

5019719~Foster's variation on a simple Tuscan classic might be considered heresy to purists, but our customers are crazy about the addition of olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach.

5009836~Springtime in Tuscany means eating young green fava beans with salty, nutty crumbles of Pecorino Toscano—a firm sheep's-milk cheese. That favorite snack was a jumping-off point for these savory little toasts. Fresh arugula, both puréed and roughly chopped, punctuates the spread with spice and texture. If you can't get your hands on fresh fava beans, frozen edamame work well, too.
5009837~Crab and mushrooms have always made good dining companions, but never more so than in this velvety soup. Serve it as the first course at a dinner party or as the centerpiece of a soup supper, with corn bread on the side.
5009838~One of the reasons I go giddy about springtime is artichokes, particularly the small ones with tips closed tightly, like a flower at night. Some home cooks are reluctant to fill their totes with artichokes, as they'll need to be turned—the barbed leaves plucked off and the other inedible bits trimmed away. I quite like the process. It's meditative and satisfying once you get the hang of it. In this dish, the fleshy artichokes get browned and crispy tops and look like strange, beautiful roses. The acidity in the white wine cuts through the rich, dense veg and, along with the salty pops from the capers, highlights the artichokes' unique herbaceousness.
5009839~This sweet-savory condiment is delicious with roasted or grilled meats.
5009840~From the delicate calamari to the crunchy celery and crisp greens, this salad is a mélange of wonderful textures. Make sure to use the freshest calamari you can find, and cook it quickly over the hot griddle to keep it as tender as possible.

5009845~Nothing could be more simple and down to earth than this tapa, but its appeal is universal. It originated in Catalunya, but can now be found all over Spain. In fact, I will never forget a breakfast of exceptional pan con tomate and steaming café con leche at an outdoor café overlooking the mountains of Granada in Galera, a town of cave dwellings. The recipe that follows has the advantage of last-minute assemblage, so the bread doesn't get soggy. Since ingredients are few, it goes without saying that the very best tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, and anchovies are essential. If last-minute preparation is not a problem, I suggest the even simpler traditional method of toasting the bread, rubbing it with a cut clove of garlic, then rubbing with a cut tomato, squeezing the tomato gently as you rub. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt.

5009847~If you prefer white-meat chicken, use skinless, boneless breasts that have been cut in half crosswise.

From time to time, we’ll run an Indian take on chips and dip using crunchy papadums (thin and crispy lentil crackers) with a cold, creamy version of dal (stewed beans and lentils). The trick is to keep the dal super light so it doesn’t snap the papadums.

5009922~Sautéing is another fast way to make a meal, especially when the pan juices are turned into a sweet and savory sauce, as they are here. This comforting dish features an array of autumn ingredients—apples, fennel, and sweet potatoes—roasted in the oven to caramelize lightly and bring their sugars to the forefront. The sauce, which mingles apple cider with the meaty browned bits in the skillet, is sharpened with a bit of Dijon mustard to balance the sweetness.
5009923~Local island vegetables are used in this colorful dish offered at Jake's in Jamaica. Serve with brown rice or as a side dish with fish or chicken.
5009924~Highly recommended!
5009925~White and red wines go equally well with pork. A lightly oaked Chardonnay and a fruity Merlot would be nice.
5009926~The broth can be served on its own as a light starter with or without the vegetables in it. It can also be used in recipes calling for canned vegetable broth.
5009927~The sweetness of honey and the bite of Campari combine in this refreshing drink; its flavor is reminiscent of grapefruit.
5009928~The dressing for this salad is based on an old Pennsylvania Dutch recipe.
5009929~Whole-wheat spaghetti can replace the soba noodles used here.
5009930~Highly recommended!
5009931~There really isn't a lot of work involved in making chicken stockyou pretty much drop everything into a pot of water and let it simmer. What you do need, though, is time and patience to let the chicken, vegetables, and herbs transform the water into a golden, savory liquid that will make all the difference in soups and sauces.
5009932~A colorful and satisfying stew is priceless this time of year, and you can't do much better than a tomatoey broth full of hearty cannellini beans, baby greens, and cubes of baked ham.
5009933~This is really a fun dessert. Form this into a mold and serve it with a cookie on the side. If you don't have time to prepare the mango sorbet, Häagen-Dazs makes a good one, and believe me, your friends will have just as much fun. The good news is that you can make this ahead of time. I serve it with fresh raspberries and raspberry sauce.
5009934~Highly recommended!
5009935~Rich, buttery parmesan and pine nuts balance out the bitter flavor that is characteristic of broccoli rabe. Serve this classic Italian side dish with steak Florentine or porchetta, or try it in a sandwich if you have leftovers.

5009940~"At the mention of this British dessert, my mind races through the various references to fools, from the fool that accompanied King Lear on his journey across the howling heath, to the modern question ""What kind of fool are you?"" But the name of this delicate dessert actually comes from the French word fouler, meaning to press or crush, referring to the crushed fruits that are gently folded into thick cream. It is this simplicity that makes the dish shine. And as the British fool, I get to choose the berries and sing ""here we go round the mulberry bush"" as I dish up!"

5009951~Who doesn’t love banana bread? This one is just sweet enough, with fabulous crunch if you add walnuts and coconut, as I always do. There’s no better solution for over-the-hill bananas, and the batter comes together in less than 10 minutes. I’ve been making this recipe — created by my late dear friend Sherry — for almost fifty years; it’s incredibly reliable.
5009952~The base of the tart is purchased puff pastry, which makes this dish — served as an appetizer at Lucques — as easy as it is delicious. With the addition of a soup, it could also be a lovely lunch or supper.

5009969~The crostini — toasted baguette slices topped with tomatoes and Parmesan — are a delicious accompaniment to the simple chick. Uncork a bottle of sparkling wine for a special touch.
5009970~The delicious sauce is also very nice with chicken and shellfish.

As simple as classic melon and prosciutto, this sweet and salty combo is made even more magical by a harmonizing ginger emulsion.

5009988~The fresh lemon juice and lemon zest give these crisp and buttery shortbreads a zesty kick.
5020074~Fluffy texture (thanks to less-starchy converted rice) and the right balance of flavors (bay, thyme, and white pepper) earn this foolproof rice its name.
5009990~Highly recommended!
5009991~Pea shoots are the young, tender tips and vines of the snow pea or the sugar snap pea plant. Once your plants are established and producing an abundance of pods, clip off leaf and tendril sections about 4 inches (10 cm) long. If you don't have your own plants, look for these tender shoots at farmers' markets or Asian grocery stores. Sambal oelek (or ulek) is an Indonesian chile paste, and tart, citrusy kaffir lime leaves are used in Southeast Asian cooking. Look for both products in Asian markets.
5009992~Diner cooks know three things about French toast: 1. Thick-cut challah is crucial. 2. Cinnamon and vanilla shouldn't be skimped on. 3. Syrup is welcome—but if you do it right, a dusting of powdered sugar is all you really need.
5009993~You can buy jars of tapenade at some specialty markets, but Jody Adams prefers the taste of homemade.
5009994~A long-standing Maryland favorite, the crab cake—plus fresh avocado and a dollop of Sriracha mayo—pumps up an iconic sandwich.
5009995~Chiles rellenos are just as good grilled as they are battered and fried. They're easier to make that way, too.
5009996~Start with tomato soup garnished with chopped fresh basil. Have deli potato salad with the main course, and for dessert, pears with Gorgonzola and biscotti.
5009997~Adding moisture and flavor without fat is achieved in the beet and Asian pear salad: Its oil-free dressing is made with mustard, lemon juice, and apple jelly (substituting apricot preserves for the jelly works well in other salads, especially those using bitter greens).
5009998~Ideal for a picnic, these sesame-speckled chicken wings are so good, you'll be happy to lick your fingers clean.
5009999~"Northern Greeks, particularly those from Salonika, eat a lot of clams and mussels, usually as mezedes. Here's an easy-to-make dish from Greece's ""second city"" Cappetino."
5010000~For the start or close of a millennium (or almost any other significant occasion), this is an opulent but fuss-free combination. Purchase the crabs from a busy fishmonger to ensure absolute freshness. Inexpensive caviar (which is often dyed) can turn the dipping sauce gray; invest a little more if you can. Champagne — not too dry — is naturally the beverage of choice.

5010018~This is a simple, delicious dessert that also makes a warming and special brunch dish or breakfast. Although many baked-apple recipes are on the lean side (my mother always ate them when she was dieting), my version is luxurious yet still homey. I stuff the apples with a mix of brown sugar, dried fruit, and nuts, then bake them in a sauce of apple cider, maple syrup, and plenty of butter, which cooks down to a rich, thick glaze. I like to use Cortlands here because of their good squat shape and their complex fruity flavor, but any firm, tart baking apple will do.

5010023~Chilaquiles, the ever-popular Mexican casserole, was created to use up stale tortillas. Made with a good sauce, the tortillas come back to life, take on all the flavors, and provide a wonderful textural contrast. Although chilaquiles are usually prepared casserole style, I have seen them made to order with scrambled eggs and chorizo. I particularly enjoy chilaquiles as a brunch item served with margaritas, chilled Mexican beer, or a hearty sangria.
5010024~If you're stopping at a Greek market for ingredients, grab some butter cookies.

5010035~Vinegar adds some pleasant zip to this side dish, which gets its richness from the sautéed bacon and onions. Serve the kale with roast pork or chicken.
5010036~Lemons and blueberries have complementary flavors. Here, the berries are arranged inside a lemony molded frozen mixture, to create the perfect dessert for serving at the height of the summer blueberry season. The mousse can be made up to 3 days in advance of serving.
5019854~Chocolate Cake with fluffy Marshmallow Frosting is a fabulous birthday treat for children and adults alike. To make a layer cake, simply double the recipe below and use two cake pans.

5010041~The rosemary-infused vodka in this drink may sound fancy, but it couldn’t be easier to make. Start it a day before you want to make the drink.
5010042~Fettuccine Alfredo, with its ribbons of pasta coasted in a luxurious cheese sauce, is the very definition of decadent comfort. This recipe is all that—redefined. Zucchini ribbons mingle harmoniously with the noodles, allowing a big serving, healthfully. The sauce is made creamy with thickened milk but kept full flavored with plenty of real, fresh grated cheese.
5010043~Highly recommended!
5010044~Chickpeas add meaty body to a home-style vegetable soup; round out the flavors with a sprinkling of grated cheese.

For the recipe, there's no need to invest in an expensive real balsamic vinegar (labeled ""tradizionale""); a decent mass-produced commercial brand works just fine. Baking, rather than boiling, the beets brings out their robust flavor."

5010072~Before I left for my trip to Israel with Steven, I had a meeting with the California Pistachio Board. They were planning a lunch at my restaurant Chi Spacca to showcase recipes I was developing that highlighted pistachios. I told them I would soon be on my way to Israel and would return with at least one Israeli recipe to add to the mix because I knew that the pistachio was the peanut of not only Israel but the entire Middle East. Indeed, pistachios were sold at nearly every market I visited in Israel and were widely deployed—and enjoyed—in many dishes. This particular recipe was inspired by the falafel I ate at the wonderful Arab market in Akko. It was so striking that after asking the falafel man what spices were involved, I went to the spice guy at the same market and requested that he recreate the blend. I was a bit concerned that he would not be able to duplicate the mix. But it turned out that my request was not unique. He quickly began grinding away as if he had done this a thousand times. My request was merely the one thousand first.
5010073~Once you've charred them, you can drizzle these eggplants with your best extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with some coarse salt for a simple side. But they're even better paired with one of the three luscious sauces (Yogurt and Sumac Sauce , Smoky Tomato Sauce , or Lemon-Mint Sauce ) and some grilled flatbread or pita.

5010086~This highly addictive stir-fried chicken continues to be one of the most popular Chinese dishes in America as the succulent, complex sauce of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy flavors is hard to pass up. For years Americanized versions often left out the Sichuan peppercorns because of an import ban, but now Sichuan peppercorns are once again easily found in Chinatown shops and even gourmet chains such as Whole Foods.

5010089~·Boeuf bourguignon may be made 1 day ahead. Cool, uncovered, then chill, covered (it tastes even better made ahead because it gives the flavors time to develop). If making ahead, it's easier to remove fat from surface after chilling.
5010090~"The dough gets its slightly tangy flavor from a ""sponge"" (a mixture of warm water, yeast, and flour thats allowed to ferment). Timing note: The sponge needs to rest overnight; the dough needs to rise for about eight hours."

5010096~I've been a big fan of the plump and succulent wonders of oysters for a long time—since even before I started frequenting one of my favorite raw bars: the one in the Blue Ribbon, in Tribeca. Something about the charm of this particular example of our sea's bounty has always intrigued me. These days I prefer local (like Cape Cod) over other types of oysters, but, still, I'm open! The accompanying salsita—which is tasty all by itself or even spread on a small salad of your favorite greens—offers a wonderful flavor and texture balance. I suggest making the accompanying sauce ahead of time so you can visit with your guests. Then just grill the oysters, plate them, and serve.
5010097~The unique texture of tapioca—creamy pudding studded with soft, slightly chewy pearls—inspires intense devotion among fans. This version gets lively citrus flavor from four incarnations of orange: zest, juice, liqueur, and fresh pieces of the fruit.

5018679~Orecchiette (little ears) is a specialty of Apulia, in southeastern Italy.
5010110~There is a historical reason why most Hanukkah menus offer foods that have been fried in oil. In the second century B.C., a one-day supply of oil inexplicably burned for eight days and eight nights after Judah Maccabee and his followers recaptured Jerusalem's Holy Temple from their Syrian oppressors. Hanukkah is the celebration of that miracle, and fried foods are served to commemorate the oil. In this country, the Eastern European potato latke is usually featured. These fritters are a Sephardic contribution to that tradition.

5010132~This is one of our family's cherished holiday dishes, a creamy, garlicky appetizer spread, full of flavor, that we enjoy on everything—good crusty bread, grilled bread, carckers, crostini, bread sticks, carrot sticks, celery sticks, even spaghetti, gnocchi, risotto.
5010133~In this delicious double dose of pork, the tenderloin stays juicy inside a crispy pancetta crust. Make sure to save any extra chutney—you'll want it for pork sandwiches the next day.
5010134~Herbed rice and sautéed cherry tomatoes are suitable accompaniments for the delicate main course.
5010135~Highly recommended!
5010136~Not to worry: There's just enough bacon in the snappy dressing to add flavor but not much fat to this colorful salad. Serve it alongside grilled chicken or fish for a healthful summer dinner.
5010137~Juicy Asian pear and a balsamic reduction play against the bitter edge of frisée—further mellowed by leeks hot from the pan.
5010138~Plum wine is transformed into a sweet but tangy glaze for the duck. At the restaurant, house-made gnocchi is used in this delicious dish. Purchased butternut squash or mushroom ravioli is our easy alternative, and you can save another step by asking the butcher to cut up the ducks for you.
5010139~Juicy scallops are rich in selenium, a mineral that protects cells from disease-causing damage in the body.

5010144~"This hearty entrée is made with rabbit, which can be found in the frozen foods section of some supermarkets or ordered from your butcher. You can also substitute chicken thighs. The ""little ear"" shape of the pasta is perfect for trapping the sauce."

5010149~Parsley and thyme replace the usual basil in this sauce. Try it on cooked vegetables.
5018247~Highly recommended!
5010151~Chicken legs, with their moist, succulent dark meat, are ideal for many cooking methods. For a last-minute dish that's abundant with the flavors of spring, we roast them with thyme, garlic, and lemon.
5010152~In this recipe, the delicious taste of risotto is blended with the crispiness and convenience of griddlecakes. They can be reheated in a very hot oven at the last minute.
5010153~This easy-to-cook bird shows off the traditional flavors of the holiday; it's one of our favorites.
5010154~If possible, use flat no-cook lasagna noodles: They look and taste more like homemade than the curly kind.
5010155~Mix chopped cucumber and tomato into plain yogurt for spooning into the pita. Also offer couscous salad and marinated vegetables from the deli. Round out the meal with baklava and grapes.
5010156~Highly recommended!
5010157~"Called ""French pasta"" at the restaurant, this Provençal-style special (using no butter and a minimum of oil) is typical of Méteigner's light French fare."
5010158~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010159~We swooned over deputy food editor Janet McCracken's pumpkin seed and cilantro pesto when she made it in the BA Test Kitchen. Now we use it on rice, pasta, roasted vegetables, and chicken, too.
5016310~If suave and hipster-hot is your idea of a dessert, you've just found it. These chile-ginger-mint jellies are an almost academic study in the contrasting sensations of hot and cool. The Chinese consider ginger to be hot—it's the source of heat in hot and sour soup—but Americans tend to view ginger more as a fresh, zinging accent of flavor. Add some fresh chile to the ginger and you introduce a new dimension of complexity that's counterbalanced by the cooling aspect of mint. The result? Your taste buds are rewarded with the dynamic duo of fiery hot and icy cold, all in one bite.

5019748~Classic Italian stock vegetables enhance this amber-gold broth for an unbeatable gravy that really complements the turkey.
5010165~This quick stock, which uses the turkey's neck, heart, and gizzard to enrich purchased turkey or chicken stock, makes enough for the stuffing, mole sauce, and turkey and gravy.
5010166~Fresh fennel and fennel seeds infuse the couscous with a subtle anise flavor.
5010167~Serve half of this fresh bread with the Tunisian Vegetable Salsa as a starter and the rest with the lamb .

5020100~My brother, Al, is an inspiring teacher at Jamie Oliver's cooking school, Recipease. This is an adaptation of one of his favorite recipes to enjoy at home. For a wonderful spring stew, try adding some blanched asparagus, peas, and beans, or top it with a crust for a comforting pie .
5010170~Peanut butter, eggs and milk deliver 13 grams of protein in each slice of this pie. Your body uses more energy to process protein than it does for fat or carbs—now get to work!
5010171~Crisp beans are paired with sour onions and a sweet maple dressing.

5010177~You've been doing it in the car when nobody's looking...but you don't have to hide anymore. It's time to come clean—and this finger-licking-good burger is so much more satisfying than those greasy drive-through hockey pucks. Plus grass-fed beef is leaner and lower in calories than conventional beef. It even contains a unique fat that may help prevent cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Talk about an afternoon delight.
5010178~I adore the kick that wasabi gives to anything in its path. Get it in powder form and add slowly to dressings or mayonnaise, or if anyone you know goes to Japan, get them to bring you back the toxic green stuff in a tube.

5010185~Refreshing in looks and taste, these light fruit sorbets served in a colorful raspberry sauce are perfect after a filling seder meal. There will be leftovers of each sorbet to enjoy later.
5010186~The richness of pork is lightened with tangy cabbage for a hearty German-style meal that seems made for autumn.
5019463~Highly recommended!
5010188~Grilled fennel, tomatoes, and scallions and cumin-rubbed grilled steak turn this quinoa salad into a one-dish dinner you'll want to keep serving all summer long.
5010189~"Leave it to the Italians to come up with such a delectable, imaginative way to round out a meal. Literally ""cooked bread,"" pancotto is the cold-weather counterpart of panzanella, Italy's summer bread salad. Use the pan drippings from the from beef tenderloin to add richness."
5010190~"""I spend as much time as I can cooking,"" writes Brigette Lyons of Allendale, New Jersey, ""and I'm equally comfortable feeding two or two hundred. I thoroughly enjoy giving sit-down meals, including an annual Christmas luncheon I do for about twenty guests. I just like to cook, period. Cooking for two hundred may be different from making weeknight dinners for myself and my husband, John, but organization is the key to both. I try to keep things on hand that are simple and easy to prepare."""

5010193~For extra-slushy Margaritas, freeze the drinks in the blender jar at least thirty minutes and up to one hour; stir, if necessary, before serving. Instead of using salt, coat the glass rims with superfine sugar: Run a lime wedge along the rims to moisten, then dip them into a shallow saucer of sugar.

5010196~A towering dessert on the holiday sideboard always gets attention. And the oohs and aahs will only get louder when you cut in to reveal its moist crumb dotted with ruby-red cranberries and topaz-colored pear. Its scent of vanilla and spices is very inviting, while the brown sugar and cinnamon glaze is, of course, the icing on the cake.

5010200~Once you've tried ice cream made with fresh mint leaves — a far cry from the neon-green stuff — you'll never go back. Here, it's enclosed in a thick robe of rich bittersweet chocolate.
5010201~For best results, use Bosc pears: They hold their shape well when baked. Top with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
5010202~Highly recommended!
5010203~Salumi refers to all dry-cured Italian-style meats and sausages. Great chefs such as Tom Colicchio, Lidia Bastianich, Mario Batali, and Paul Bertolli are introducing them to a new generation of Americans, who may not realize what an incredible variety is available. Thanks to these chefs for bringing this artisan tradition back to the culinary fore. What an inspiration! One summer when I traveled in Italy, I was served salumi with peaches just about everywhere I went and although it was a combination I had never before tried, it made perfect and delicious sense and stayed with me after I returned to Chicago.

5010206~This streamlined version of the classic Spanish dish comes together in about an hour—and doesn't require a special paella pan. Sugar snap peas add fresh flavor and nice crunch.
5010207~Highly recommended!
5010208~To make this easy dish even easier, prepare just the dressing and use two cups of packaged broccoli, coleslaw, a mixture of shredded broccoli stems, carrots and red cabbage.
5010209~A classic Moroccan tagine (or stew) is typically made with meat. This satisfying vegetarian main course features three kinds of root vegetables—and a delicious spicy, crunchy chickpea garnish.
5010210~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5010211~"""I'm from India,"" writes Hema Kundargi of Cupertino, California, ""and I enjoy the foods of my homeland. My children are the opposite — they like 'American' food. But I haven't given up trying to make Indian meals that the whole family will like. This recipe pleases everyone."""

5010216~"In 1930, Simon Agranat, the chief justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, wrote to his aunt and uncle in Chicago: ""I had my eighth successive egg meal during my three-day journey through the Emek (the valley)."" Eggs have always been a main protein for the people in Israel. When I lived in Jerusalem, I would make for my breakfast—or even for dinner—scrambled eggs with sauteed spring onions, fresh herbs, and dollops of cream cheese melted into the eggs as they were cooking. Probably the most popular egg dish in Israel is shakshuka, one of those onomatopoeic Hebrew and North African words, meaning ""all mixed up."" The most famous rendition of this tomato dish, which is sometimes mixed with meat but more often made in Israel with scrambled or poached eggs, is served at the Tripolitana Doktor Shakshuka Restaurant in Old Jaffa."

5010221~If you like curries, you'll love this recipe. The sauce is rich with coconut flavor and redolent with spice. Don't be alarmed by the number of red chiles — these are mild.
5010222~Tamales—meat or vegetable fillings surrounded by masa dough and steamed in softened corn-husk packets—are a Latin American staple, and this rendition cleverly showcases corn in three distinct forms. Kernels of fresh sweet corn brighten up a dough made from corn tortilla flour. (Adding cornmeal to store-bought masa flour helps mimic the texture of fresh tamale dough, a trick we picked up from Magda Bogin at the Cocinar Mexicano cooking school in the town of Tepoztlán.) Poblano chiles add a touch of heat, but it's the time on the grill that gives the tamales real fire. The husks develop a light char, and the smoky flavor penetrates the tamale, accenting the corn in all its dimensions beautifully.
5010223~The chile-tamarind sauce is a refined, complex variation on classic satay sauce, which is traditionally thickened with peanuts. This rendition owes its silky texture to mashed kabocha squash. At Arun's, this is served both as an appetizer and as a main course.
5010224~Bacon and scallops always pair beautifully, but it's the mixture of sugar and spice that transforms these easy-to-make hors d'oeuvres.
5010225~With super fresh tomatoes you don't need much more! This toast combines sharp ricotta salata cheese with plump green tomatoes and lemon juice for a refreshing bite. We like green zebra tomatoes for their pretty yellow stripes and bright, floral flavor, but any ripe green tomato will work in this dish.
5018725~Highly recommended!
5010227~This recipe is used to prepare Grilled Tuna and Roasted Peppers Sandwiches on Thyme Focaccia and Presciutto, Mozzarella, and Olive Sandwiches on Parmesan Focaccia .
5010228~Ground ginger and crystallized ginger amp up the flavor of the cake; fresh ginger adds a spicy hit to the fresh strawberries. The Bundt pan is coated with raw sugar before the batter is added, giving the cake a sparkly crust.
5010229~Marinating the vegetables overnight gives this fresh salad terrific flavor.
5010230~This earthy pasta dish is delicious made with the wide, long noodles called pappardelle, or with the thinner and more readily available fettuccine.

5010238~"The technique: Streusel—a crumbly mixture of flour, butter, sugar, and spices—often shows up on coffee cakes. The sweet, crunchy stuff also makes a great pie-topper.
The payoff: You have to roll out only one pie crust instead of two, and the streusel adds texture and flavor."
5010239~This fragrant stew is great over couscous.
5010240~A press-in crust makes this party-worthy dessert easy to put together. For a pretty presentation, don't cover the lime curd completely with berries. The contrast between the dark berries and the bright lime curd is striking.
5010241~Rouille is synonymous with bouillabaisse, the Provençal seafood soup. The rust-red sauce is traditionally prepared by blending chiles, garlic, olive oil, and breadcrumbs. This easy, mayonnaise-based version is delicious with fried fish and seafood.
5010242~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 40 min
5010243~This compote is delicious with roast pork as well as with the Thanksgiving bird. We left the shallots whole to enhance the texture.

5010246~I admit that I'm hard on sugar snap peas. I get disappointed when they suck, of course, but I also get grumpy when they're anything less than perfect—unblemished, super sweet, and not a bit starchy. That's the curse of keeping high standards, I suppose: you're so rarely satisfied. When at last I do find perfect snap peas, I make this salad. I leave them raw—only the finest snap peas can be this delightful without a dunk in boiling water—and accentuate their flavor with little more than a lemony dressing and mint. If you'd like, you could add some creamy goat cheese in blobs or good old burrata alongside.
5010247~Serve with: Tomato salad with red onions and blue cheese.
5010248~Braised dishes are often served with a creamy side like mashed potatoes, polenta, or grits. Black beans offer an earthy change of pace and complement the chile purée.

5018276~Chilly as July and August can be in San Francisco, you know it's summer when this delicious corn hits the Tacolicious menu. (It is so good that it transports you to sunshine, even if the city is socked in by fog and you're wearing a scarf.) If you already have the recado ready to go, this recipe is a cinch to make. Although the smokiness of the grill imparts great flavor, you can instead briefly boil the corn ears, halve them, and toss them with the recado-lime juice mixture. With the lime and the spices, no butter is needed. Try swapping out the corn for another vegetable, such as summer squash. To keep this recipe in the snack realm, chop the ears into thirds.
5019748~Browning the neck and giblets, as well as the vegetables, produces a wonderfully rich stock and, subsequently, a much more flavorful gravy.
5010258~Low-fat mozzarella cheese makes this a rich-tasting dish for brunch or a simple supper.
5010259~Highly recommended!
5010260~We found that using finely stone-ground cornmeal yielded a denser, slightly heavier fritter than regular stone-ground cornmeal. Though both tasted the same, we preferred the texture of the fritter made with regular cornmeal.
5010261~Be sure to use extra-ripe mangoes when preparing this rich, creamy dessert.

5010287~All but the most experienced of crêpe chefs will admit that the first crêpe in a batch is often not of the best quality. The level of heat under the skillet needs to be fine-tuned as you go. With that in mind, our recipe makes enough batter for 2 crêpes, even though you'll only need 1 for this hors d'oeuvre. If the first crêpe comes out well, freeze the extra, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, to use another evening.
5010288~Editor's note: Use this recipe to make Norma Naranjo's Tamales .
5016704~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010290~In this recipe there will be extra mousse and pecan crisps (the recipes will not work if reduced). Both elements are delicious on their own.
5010291~This salad is so much lighter and fresher-tasting than mayonnaise-based versions. It gets crispy sweetness from sugar snaps and peppers and nuttiness from tahini. Keep in mind that tahini can turn rancid rather quickly (even in unopened cans, in our experience). We recommend buying it from a place with a high turnover, such as a Middle Eastern market or a natural foods store.
5010292~Offer crackers and some coleslaw along with the chowder. Lemon meringue pie is a perfect way to end the meal.
5010293~Sizzling with fresh ingredients, this lively Asian stir-fry keeps prep time to a bare minimum without sacrificing flavor.
5010294~My original recipe for these deeply coffee-flavored and amply chocolate-flecked cookies produced a classic shortbread with the melt-in-your-mouth texture that’s the hallmark of great shortbread and the result of using only confectioners’ sugar in the dough. When I adapted the recipe for Beurre & Sel and baked the cookies in metal rings, constraining their spreadability, the change was anything but subtle: The sablés were still tender, but their texture became denser and their flavor more intense.
5010295~You can tell this recipe hails from a tropical environment because of the way the first bite of chiles causes a light sweat to break out on your brow. Then a breeze blows by, and— ahh—you're instantly cooled off and refreshed, able to fully enjoy the sweetness of plump shrimp and an evolving harmony of spices.

5010300~Trompe l'oeil as much as hors d'oeuvres, these rolls use carrot where nori would usually be at a sushi bar and boneless beef top loin instead of tuna. The pungent mustard sauce is an artful counterpoint to the sweet carrot.
5010301~Skip the mess of deep frying. Pumpkin seed- and panko-crusted fish stays extra crispy when baked on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet, which allows air to circulate around the pieces.
5010302~Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 3 hr

5010304~Tangy and refreshing, this dip is called tzatziki in Greek. Here, it's served with crisp baked pita wedges, but it also goes well with crudités. Drain the yogurt a day before you plan to prepare the dip. And mix up a big batch of lemonade to pour throughout the picnic.
5010305~Traditional duck confit is not only cooked in fat but also preserved for a period of time. A true confit has a unique flavor developed as it ages in duck fat. You can make it the traditional way, buy ready-made confit, or use the cooking method described here, called sous vide (under vacuum).
5010306~Highly recommended!
5010307~The recipe for this moist, dark, fragrant gingerbread pays tribute to Dona Abramson and Stuart Tarabour at the Bright Food Shop, a terrific little Mexican-fusion café in Chelsea where I spent some time. This was my favorite of their desserts, and it has since become a seasonal classic at Gramercy Tavern, though I've made a few adaptations and embellished a bit. My recipe has just a touch of cloves, and instead of just the ginger and cinnamon in a typical gingerbread, I use a panoply of spices, including cardamom, nutmeg, and a lot of fresh ginger, to give the cake a racy, intriguing flavor.
5010308~If you can't get cotija cheese, you can substitute feta — it's stronger in flavor and a bit saltier than cotija, but it works fine. Archibald also makes a version of this salad topped with shavings of Manchego cheese.
5010309~This recipe serves 4 as a main course if you set aside 2 chicken breasts for another meal. Otherwise, it serves 6.
5010310~A thin layer of plum jam beneath the custard is visually gorgeous—it's a magenta pinstripe just under the pumpkin orange—and provides a surprisingly delicious twist, since the tart plums bring out the best in all the other traditional flavors of pumpkin pie.
5010311~Fresh ginger and yellow mustard seeds make these sweet potatoes much more worldly than their candied incarnations. The cilantro takes them in an unexpected but very welcome direction.

5010338~Nearly every family stir-fries bok choy year-round, but it’s also prized as a vegetable for such special occasions as New Year’s. The mastery here is in choosing young tender bok choy, no more than eight inches in length. Or, occasionally, you might get lucky enough to find hearts of bok choy, bok choy sum, in the produce market. Unlike the older bok choy, these vegetables are so tender that the stalks do not need to be peeled. Stir fry the vegetables on high heat just until the greens are bright and the stalks are tender. A minute too much, and the vegetables lose their essence. Bok choy found in Western supermarkets is often old and past its prime, while the bok choy available in Asian markets is far superior in quality and much less expensive.
5010339~This soup can be pureed by pressing it through a strainer or a food mill. It can also be pureed in a blender and then strained.
5010340~Mayonnaise with lemon and thyme gives both extra freshness and a golden-brown crust to delicate, slightly sweet pollock.
5010341~The popular rum-and-mint cocktail from Cuba was the inspiration for this entrée. A last-minute spritz of grilled lime adds even more flavor. Garnish with grilled pineapple slices cut into star shapes, if desired.
5010342~Floating on the surface of this pale, silky soup, which tastes of the essence of parsley, is a trompe l'oeil surprise: What looks like shaved truffles is actually thinly sliced chestnuts, adding a nutty sweetness.

5010350~Highly recommended!
5010351~Looking to jazz up a backyard barbecue? The bold flavors in this burger will definitely get guests talking. A paste of lemongrass, garlic, ginger, and serrano chile enlivens ground turkey, while also helping to keep it moist. If you don't have a mini food processor, don't be discouraged. It may take longer, but it's still worth the effort to finely chop the ingredients and mash them to a paste using a mortar and pestle. A spicy lime vinaigrette takes the place of traditional condiments.
5010352~Salt-and-vinegar chips and Guinness will turn this into a pub dinner.
5010353~"The restaurant takes its name from amuse-bouche, a small gift from the chef to ""please the mouth."" Chicken thighs make a convenient substitute for duck in this pasta dish."

When we were first married, we had dinner parties several times a week — it got to the point where people would call me around 4:30 in the afternoon and ask, 'What's for dinner?' We're still having people over and we're still informal, especially in the summer. Everyone sits around the large island in our kitchen, drinking wine and eating appetizers. Usually there's grilled chicken or fish or a simple main-course salad for dinner. It's our favorite menu."""

5010358~Cutting the vegetables into similarly sized pieces helps them cook at the same rate, so this entire dish—sauce included—can be made in one pan.

5010360~A pretty pink dessert that is refreshing and light. Plums with dark purple skin or flesh will give the sherbet beautiful color. Serve a pot of green tea alongside.
5010361~Key limes are also known as Mexican or West Indian limes. If you can't find them in your area, substitute bottled Key lime juice. We've tried several different brands in our test kitchens, and prefer the taste of Manhattan.* This recipe is modified from the classic one found on many condensed milk and Key lime juice labels; we've added additional lime juice for more tartness.

5010368~What to drink: Serve a splurge-worthy aged rum in a snifter, to sip like brandy.
5010369~Melon wedges wrapped in prosciutto make a lovely first course; the garlic mashed potatoes, baked tomato halves topped with Parmesan, and an Italian Chardonnay are perfect with the fish. Offer an arugula salad after the main course, and fresh strawberries in grappa with lemon sorbet and biscotti for dessert.
5010370~This simple sauce goes well with spring rolls as a dipping sauce. Also, it makes a good marinade for seafood. I once served grilled trout marinated in this sauce to a friend who disliked fish—it completely changed his mind!
5010371~Use leftover chicken if you have any on hand, or start with a rotisserie chicken. Be sure to pick up the sliced peppers from the salad bar while you're at the market. Crunchy sesame breadsticks are all you need to complete the meal — except, of course, dessert, which could be pineapple slices sprinkled with coconut and broiled.

I loved that, and occasionally follow her lead for just a regular Tuesday night meal. To stuff, place half the meatloaf mixture in the loaf pan. Using a spoon, make a well down the length of the middle, then add thawed frozen spinach and mozzarella cheese into the well. Cover with remaining mixture and proceed as directed.

5015927~As convenient as store-bought duck confit is, we find that its quality tends to vary. Making your own allows you to control the spicing and the cooking time to produce a velvety piece of meat. This ancient preservation method has three parts: First you cure the duck legs in salt (drawing out the water in which microorganisms can live), then you slowly cook them in fat, and finally you store them fully covered in the cooking fat so air can't get in.
5019000~Traditionally used to season pâtés and terrines, this French spice mixture also adds an earthy depth to the duck confit.

5010431~The following recipe produces a coarse-crumbed cake; for ease of slicing, dip you knife in hot water before cutting each serving.
5010432~Redeye gravy is traditionally made from ham drippings, water, and coffee, the last being an optional ingredient. Here we've enriched the savory braising liquid from lamb shanks with bacon (instead of ham drippings) for a new twist on an old favorite.
5010433~In this version of cassoulet, garlic-crumb topping is served on the side. Rather than acting as a thickener, the crumbs give our brothy version of the dish a crisp layer of texture.
5010434~Instead of Panela, other soft white Mexican cheeses — such as Oaxaca, or those used for making quesadillas — work well in this recipe. If none is available, substitute Monterey Jack cheese. The stuffed chilies can be assembled one day before baking. What to drink: A Napa or New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (or any dry but fruity white wine).
5010435~Nutty caraway adds a pop of flavor to this sweet combination of apples, beets, and carrots.

5017537~Hoppin' John is a traditional southern dish of black-eyed peas and salt pork served with rice. Here, it's a risotto dotted with black-eyed peas and flavored with bacon and pancetta. This is an unconventional method for making risotto — rather than slowly adding hot stock to the rice, Rollins adds it, unheated, in just 2 batches. This will allow you more time for preparing the chops that go along with it.

5010453~It was a challenge for me to write a recipe for vegetable stock, because in truth, mine is different every time. I am inspired to make it whenever I am prepping lots of veggies, and I realize that what I have left over—the tops of four leeks, three parsnip stubs, carrot peels and tips, and a pile of parsley stems—is almost everything I need to make a great stock. When faced with the decision to capture these flavors so they can become the foundation for future delicious soups, stews, or beans, versus adding them to my compost pile, I try to choose the former. Once you experience how much better your recipes turn out with homemade stock (not to mention how much money you save and how many cartons you keep out of the trash), youll get more motivated. I usually keep a bag in the fridge where I save my veggie scraps, and when it gets big enough, I set my pot on the stove. The recipe below is simple and easy. You can also add corncobs, potato skins, mushroom bottoms, and even tomatoes. If you have a huge stockpot, as I do, you can easily double or triple this recipe. I keep as much stock in the refrigerator as I plan to use within 5 days and freeze the rest. —Myra
5010857~Alioli, a very popular Spanish sauce, goes well with almost anything—from grilled meat to vegetables to seafood. Although the authentic version is an emulsion of garlic and oil, eggs are commonly added (especially in restaurants) because they make the sauce less fragile and easier to whip up. We've made ours even easier by using store-bought mayonnaise.

5010469~A platter of marinated chicken is always a popular buffet item, and I've been serving this at my parties for years. Choose cilantro, basil, or even parsley to fit your fancy or your guests' taste (I have cilantro-haters in my crowd, and you may, too). For the juiciest results, use bone-in, skin-on chicken. This marinade works well to protect skinless chicken from drying out — just reduce the baking time by a few minutes.
5010470~You'll use some of the dressing for the grilled chicken and the rest for the noodle salad .
5010471~This is a modern rendition of a nineteenth-century recipe that ultimately became the legendary canard a l'orange, though it bears little resemblance to the gloppy 1960s version of duck a l'orange served in this country. This is much lighter and just a little bitter. The sauce was originally made with sour Seville oranges (bigarade is the Provençal term for these sour citrus), and if you can find them, by all means use them. Citrus and waterfowl are a perfect pair, and they both happen to be in season at the same time. Any skin-on duck breasts will work with this recipe, but I prefer Muscovy or large wild duck breasts.

5010509~"Italian wheat pies—filled with a rich ricotta custard studded with tender wheat berries—are associated with Easter celebrations, but according to author Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez, rice pies are just as classic and in her estimation, taste better. Eriquez had been making wheat pies for years when she had some extra dough a while back and used it to make a rice pie. ""My family went berserk. They went crazy for it!"" said Eriquez with a laugh. ""Rice is more tender. It has a nicer taste than wheat,"" she explained. ""If you give my family a choice, they're going to ask for the rice before the wheat."" The pastry dough, pasta frolla, is delicate and tears easily, so if it softens, quickly chill it in the freezer for a few minutes. And don't worry about the tears; they patch easily."

5010576~A good hit of curry spices up this classic. Begin marinating the chicken in the buttermilk mixture the night before.
5010577~If you don't have both spices, it's okay to omit one or the other.

5010584~These plump, fried hors d'oeuvres, a seafood variation on Chile's signature baked onion-and-meat-filled empanadas, are hot and juicy. Have plenty of napkins ready.
5010585~Although the marinade sounds similar to several of those given for tofu, it's just different enough that, when used on the completely different tempeh, you have a wholly distinct, and wholly delicious, dish. This is a base preparation. Use the baked tempeh as part of a component plate, sauced or unsauced, cut up as the filling for spring rolls with tempeh, added to a vegetable stir-fry, or as the centerpiece of a hearty sandwich.
5010586~Smoked Salmon, Hard-Boiled Egg, Tomatoes, Greens and Caper-Onion Mayo
5010587~Two racks make enough for each person to have two chops. Cut between each bone individually for single chops, or cut into double-rib portions.

5010590~Crab is an old favorite of mine. This dish has such fresh clean flavors, and is best eaten with fresh crusty bread and a glass of chilled white wine.
5010591~The soup can also be served warm.
5010592~Highly recommended!
5010593~Crisp toppings may vary as to how much sugar, butter, oats, nuts, and flour they contain, but one thing's for sure: All have a crumbly topping that crisps up during baking.
5010594~This salsa verde, which balances a meal full of spiced dishes, would also complement anything from grilled steak to steamed vegetables.

5010599~Highly recommended!
5010600~Patience is the key to this soul-satisfying soup chock-full of winter greens. Its depth of flavor comes from cooking the soffritto—a mixture of pancetta, onion, celery, carrots, and the ribs from the chard—for a good 45 minutes and from browning the tomato paste. The result is so savory that there's no need for broth; water, canned tomatoes, and a parmesan rind work beautifully. And because this soup must cook slowly, don't worry about prepping all your vegetables before you begin—you can simply chop as you go.

5010613~The secret to homemade brittle? Work fast—it hardens quickly.

5010618~The simplicity and speed of this dish belie its deep, complex flavor — sweet, sour, spiced, and savory. Although the plums that once grew all over Epirus have been lost to more profitable crops, plums and prunes still appear in many of the region's dishes.

5010624~The combination of garam masala — a blend of sweet and hot spices — and a light sugar syrup adds so much flavor to this refreshing salad that no oil is necessary. The spice blend subtly enhances the natural sweetness of the pear and the avocado, while lending an aromatic note.
5010625~Editor's note: The recipe below is part of a healthy and delicious spa menu developed exclusively for Epicurious by Lake Austin Spa Resort.

5010628~Make this intriguing sauce ahead, then just heat it up while the pasta cooks.
5010629~Highly recommended!
5010630~Throughout the season, quail is always on the Highlands menu. We stuff them with ham, tasso, chicken liver, foie gras, crawfish, or corn bread. Our quail come from a farm in South Carolina, but most butchers or specialty markets sell semi-boneless quail, ideal for stuffing. (Editor's Note: The recipe below is for four quail, enough to serve two people as a main course. If you are cooking for more people, chef Stitt recommends that you prepare two quail for each extra person and adjust the other ingredients proportionally.)
5010631~Active time: 10 min Start to finish: 50 min
5010632~Folding sweet jumbo lump crabmeat and chopped scallions into the classic batter of cornmeal and buttermilk dresses up these pups for a party. They're crisp, fluffy, and, truth be told, dangerously easy to eat, especially after a dip in a lemony homemade tartar sauce speckled with parsley, sweet pickles, and capers. For information about crabmeat.
5010633~Serve the carnitas with mashed sweet potatoes, mixed baby greens, or rolled up in warm tortillas with salsa, chopped onions, and cilantro. Berkshire pork lends the best flavor, but a regular pork butt or shoulder is also delicious. Be sure to keep the oil at moderate heat, which will cook the pork perfectly without overbrowning.

5010640~"When purchasing rack of lamb, ask your butcher to remove the chine bone as well as any excess surface fat and to ""french"" or clean, the rib bones. To create a really flavorful spice coating for the lamb, Hayden recommends using high-quality coffee and dark, strong Valrhona cocoa. For the salad, Fleming likes to use a spicy Tuscan olive oil to give the vinaigrette an extra kick of flavor."

5010645~Chef Charlie Palmer shared this recipe for one of his signature dishes at his Dry Creek Kitchen restaurant in Sonoma, California, exclusively with Epicurious. Crisp-skinned, juicy duck breasts are accented with gingery fried rice and sweet roasted peaches for a stunning dish that's surprisingly simple to make. Note that the recipe makes more than enough soy-lime emulsion for the fried rice. Leftover emulsion, which will keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to three days, can be used in stir-fries and salads or as a sauce for tuna tartare or dumplings.

5010649~The herbaceous and tangy blend of spices in za'atar lend a unique bright flavor to this colorful salad.
5010650~This variation on the classic yassa uses carrots and pimento-stuffed olives to create a rich chicken stew. It always comes up a winner. The chicken should marinate at least three hours before cooking.
5010651~Tender pieces of short rib and barley add body to a delicate herbal broth you can make ahead and enjoy for days.
5010652~Smith slyly doctors the sweet-tart Italian condiment to gain an unmistakable berry flavor with a little tangy crunch.
5010653~Purchased mayo gets dressed up with garlic, Dijon, and lemon juice.

5010661~Highly recommended!
5010662~Stitt likes to use rock salt — the kind used for old-fashioned ice cream churners — as a bed for these oysters because it keeps the shells from tipping and sliding around in the pan and on the plates. Rock salt is sold at many supermarkets, but kosher salt is a good substitute.
5010663~Aperol is similar to Campari but sweeter and less boozy. This recipe works with either one.
5010664~Steady medium heat is best for grilling wings; they need time for the fat to render and the skin to crisp.
5015240~It's worth the extra effort to make this rich stock; the slow-simmered taste produces a sauce that far exceeds any made with canned beef broth.
5010666~A bowl of fresh fruit and some mixed nuts would be very nice go-withs here.
5010667~Store-bought vanilla frozen yogurt acts as the luscious foil for oranges, pineapple, mango and bananas in a fat-free brown sugar-cinnamon sauce.
5010668~Many of us love a curry, and this is my absolute favorite. It’s rich in flavor but won’t leave you in that post-curry slump. I love this because it’s so simple and everything’s made in one pot—perfect to share or enjoy alone, and I don’t think it needs any rice!

5010680~"""Five years ago, I threw my first dinner party,"" writes Kristin McGill of Chicago, Illinois. ""It was a memorable night with good friends, great food and lots of wine. That night, cooking became my passion. And despite all of the effort, I still love to throw parties. My husband, Henry, and I host get-togethers once or twice a month. I do most of the preparation — admittedly that's because I enjoy cooking so much that I prefer to have the kitchen to myself. But I have to confess that since I started sharing the counter space, I've discovered we make a great team."""

5010684~Highly recommended!
5010685~This quick-and-easy garnish would also make a great cocktail snack.
5010686~The shrimp could also be skewered and grilled instead of broiled. Either way, they're lovely arranged atop pimiento-flecked rice pilaf and served with steamed snow peas and a basket of warm corn muffins. Blueberry or strawberry shortcakes are the perfect dessert.
5010687~The fresh flavors of fennel and orange make this simple fish dish shine. You can serve it alone or with a helping of rice.
5010688~Moderately priced avruga caviar (smoked herring roe from Spain) gives cooks a chance to throw caution to the wind and experiment. Stephen Harris purées it into a slate-gray emulsion, bringing visual drama and a smoky flavor to delicate salmon. Fleur de sel is a good substitute for his house-made sea salt.
5010689~The agrodolce (tart-and-sweet) flavors of vinegar and raisins used in marinating the fish are typical of Jewish-Italian cooking.
5010690~This dessert, prominent in the window of virtually every Paris pastry shop, is a true classic. The puff pastry rounds are usually filled with an almond mixture, but my version features hazelnuts and chocolate. Purchased pastry makes it approachable for the modern cook. Since it reheats nicely, the Pithiviers can be made ahead.
5010691~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but may require additional unattended time.
5010692~In this dish, Elena Rovera prefers the clean, fruity flavor of Roero Arneis, a dry white wine from the Piedmont region of Italy. She typically serves the chicken with rosemary potatoes.
5010693~Highly recommended!
5010694~Radishes make a crunchy salsa for these–or any other taco you're serving this summer.
5010695~This dessert is a dense and rich chocolate mousse-like cake chilled in a mold.
5010696~This summer, Marino grew about 85 tomato varieties in his garden; he uses his harvest in this caprese. Burrata cheese, a fresh mozzarella filled with cream and curds, is available at some supermarkets, Italian markets, and cheese stores. Fresh whole-milk mozzarella can be substituted.
5010697~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010698~Editor's note: Chef Roberto Santibañez, the chef/owner of Fonda in Brooklyn, New York shared this recipe as part of a festive taco party menu he created for Epicurious. He recommends serving this salsa with his Carnitas or Carne Adobada Tacos .

5010700~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010701~Green chilies and cilantro add some zip to this main course.
5010702~Hold off on the holly sprigs. The only centerpiece your table needs is a showstopping crown roast of pork that's fit for a queen—and a crowd. Once you've got the two racks tied together, making this is as simple as any other roast.
5010703~This is an impressive three-layered popsicle. Make sure each layer is completely frozen before adding the next, as it looks great when the layers are really well defined.
5010876~This cinnamon-and coriander-spiced chutney combines wine, raisins and citrus. Serve with the Barbecue Turkey with Maple-Mustard Glaze, or as an appetizer with goat cheese and crusty bread.
5010705~This version of the much maligned Christmas classic is deliciously lacking in candied cherries, giant mixed nuts and citron, but it is filled with bits of marzipan and lots of appealing dried fruit. Baking the cakes in disposable aluminum loaf pans (available at supermarkets) or in decorative cardboard loaf pans (available at some cookware stores or by mail order) makes gift giving easy; just wrap each cake in its pan in cellophane, and add a colorful ribbon.

5010716~Serve buttered noodles, potato salad or rice pilaf alongside this entree.
5010717~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010718~Once esteemed as a preservation method, cooking and keeping duck in its rendered fat results in meltingly tender, moist, and extremely flavorful meat which can be used in a variety of simple preparations. Sear the duck legs in a hot skillet or shred the meat and add it to salads, or, perhaps best of all, make duck rillettes. Just remember the duck must be salted a day before you plan to cook it.

5013517~Yogurt curdles easily when heated, but mixing it with egg white and cornstarch, and then simmering it, makes the yogurt more heat-stable without changing the flavor significantly.
5010736~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010737~Inspired by the classic steakhouse wedge, this salad gets a double hit of smokiness thanks to the bacon and grilled iceberg.
5010738~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5010739~This is an elegant way to make a whole lot of chicken that tastes really good. It's kind of sweet and sour—sweet from the apricot preserves and the plums, and sour from the bit of vinegar. But what makes this dish are the sage leaves. They give a distinctive taste and make it a beautiful, festive platter that you can really be proud of.
5010740~Spiced tea and sweetened condensed milk are the keys here.
5010741~Jasper Soffer, bartender at the Mulberry Project in New York City, created this simple-to-prepare seasonal cocktail for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. The rhubarb simple syrup, Soffer explains, is simultaneously sweet and tart, not unlike a rhubarb-apple crumble or a strawberry-rhubarb pie. If you want to make this drink outside rhubarb's short early-spring season, frozen fruit makes a great substitute.
5010742~So many German settlers carried their gingerbread treats to small towns around this country that the sweetly spiced cakes and cookies have become an all-American tradition. Coated with a chocolate ganache glaze, the homey cake of holidays past is transformed into a special-occasion dessert.

5010760~Lo mein is a noodle dish that often is confused with chow mein, and many Chinese restaurants further the confusion by using the two names interchangeably. The dishes are similar, both featuring noodles mixed with stir-fried meat and vegetables and a savory sauce. But whereas chow mein refers to parboiled and stir-fried noodles, lo mein refers to noodles that are fully cooked separately and quickly tossed with sauce in the wok. The roast pork in this recipe is char siu, the same gorgeous reddish-brown pork often displayed and sold in Chinatown shop windows. Instead of buying the pork ready-made, you can also roast your own at home. For the egg noodles, you can use any that are thin and round; spaghetti will also work.
5010761~Serve with: Pickled beets and baby potatoes sprinkled with parsley. Dessert: Lemon bars from the bakery.

5010764~Market tip: Many Greek cheeses are made with goat's milk or sheep's milk. Kefalotyri is hard and salty; Pecorino Romano is a good substitute.

5010771~Port and orange juice accent this cranberry and dried fig sauce.
5010772~Magret duck breasts come from Moulard ducks; you can also use smaller Muscovy duck breasts. Both are available at some supermarkets or at dartagnan.com.
5010773~A perfect cube is not essential, but try to get the lamb into roughly the same size pieces so they cook at the same rate.
5010774~Chestnuts are harvested in the area around Alba and figure in many savory and sweet dishes there, particularly stews like this ragout. Gathered after they have fallen, chestnuts are traditionally served with game, but they also pair well with veal-another staple of northern Italian cuisine. If fresh chestnuts are unavailable, roasted vacuum-packed chestnuts-sold in jars in the specialty foods section of many supermarkets-can be used. Supply crusty bread for soaking up the juices. Accompany with a radicchio and escarole salad, and uncork a Barolo.
5013995~This creamy, garlicky tahini sauce also pairs wonderfully with lamb. Serve it as a dipping sauce, or as a spread on cold lamb sandwiches.
5010776~Slightly sweet, tangy, and spicy all at once, the easy sauce doubles the flavor of quick-cooking thin-sliced chicken breasts.
5010777~Bake this at least a day before serving.

5010781~"""I grew up in the middle of Croatia, near Zagreb, where the cuisine is very heavy — lots of meat and potatoes,"" writes Snjezana Hercigonja of Raleigh, North Carolina. ""But when I was young, it was customary to vacation on the Mediterranean coast in the summer, where you go to the market every day to see what's good, and everything is really fresh and light.

5010795~This intoxicating champagne cocktail was named after a French 75-millimeter gun used in World War I. Many American bartenders claimed to have invented the drink. One recipe, from 1919, called for absinthe, Calvados, and gin, but no champagne. Supposedly, the champagne version was introduced at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in 1925. Or the cocktail might have originated with American soldiers in Paris, who added gin and liqueur to champagne to crank up its potency.

5010800~It’s unclear just who the Louis of Crab Louis salad fame was; perhaps he was affiliated with the Olympic Club in Seattle, where opera star Enrico Caruso, who visited there in 1904, is said to have fallen in love with the crab salad. San Francisco also claims the dish, which reached its zenith there in the teens, as a specialty at Solari’s restaurant and at the St. Francis Hotel.

5010802~Tea-marbled eggs are a time-honored part of Chinese cuisine. The outer shell of a hard-boiled egg is cracked (but not removed), and the egg is then soaked in tea, which gives it a lovely marbled appearance and subtle smoky flavor. We found traditionally cooked tea-marbled eggs — usually simmered for an hour — were too tough for our taste; this method yields more tender whites.

5010806~"Since I was little, I have thrilled at reading food-related passage in novels. But the food scenes in Some Day by Israeli novelish Shemi Zarhin are on another level. In one passage, Zarhin describes a dish so vividly, I felt compelled to re-create it in my own kitchen He writes: ""Ruchama...fried onions and sprinkled garlic cloves...seasoned it with spicy green pepper and coriander seeds and squeezed a lemon and placed a pile of beet leaves...in the middle, and within seconds, the green pile sunk into the pot and became an aromatic green sauce, into which Ruchama chopped cubes of sheep's milk cheese and broke three eggs and dripped olive oil."" As I read and my mouth watered, I realized that Ruchama is essentially making a tomato-free version of the North African poached egg dish, shakshuka. Riffing off the ""recipe,"" I experimented with a spinach shakshuka and, like Ruchama, ended up mopping it up with pita ""with great pleasure."""

5010815~It's best to serve this lobster salad right after you make it, rather than preparing it in advance. If the salad stands for more than half an hour, pineapple enzymes will alter the texture of the lobster meat.

Because Ryan Howard is a conscientious eater, however, this version is a lighter version that still packs some punch from the familiar flavors of the original.

With the recent rise of quinoa's popularity in the United States, and the fact that it's not a true grain but rather the seed of a broadleaf plant, some circles of Judaism have approved of and welcomed it to the Passover table, while others have not. If you feel comfortable serving it this Passover, you will love how it absorbs the vinaigrette, bright with lemon and enriched with finely grated hard-boiled eggs, and how it forms a tender bed for the ribbons of scallion and raw asparagus.

5010884~You can find Thumbelina carrots at farmers' markets.
5010885~I like to think of tofu as a blank canvas just waiting for the application of texture and color. Here, I've panfried it to crisp the edges and draped it in a velvety Vietnamese-style caramel sauce. A shower of fresh herbs and browned shallots gives it an extra layer of flavor. If you prep the herbs and make the sauce ahead, you can put this on the table in under half an hour.
5010886~We hit upon our favorite recipe a few summers back, when we helped out a buddy with his annual Labor Day pig roast in Connecticut. In addition to the 125-pound porker we were planning to serve, we decided we should have some chicken just in case not everyone at the party wanted to partake of the sacred swine. We got about 100 birds, halved them, and soaked them in a simple marinade of just lemon, sage, and cracked black pepper. It turned out to be one of the first times—maybe the only time—there was a pig roast where chicken was the hit of the day. What really made it special was the marinade. It lent a nice acidity to the meat, which became really tender, and the sage and lemon flavors just exploded. For the most classic presentation, roast a whole bird and carve it tableside. If you want an especially crispy, golden-skinned chicken, have your butcher halve it, and roast the halves skin side up so they can self-baste as they roast.
5010887~This one can also be a spritzer. Pour into a collins or highball glass and top with a little club soda.
5010888~Sangria doesn’t have to be a sugary mess. Grilled stone fruit adds a natural caramelized sweetness to this refreshing drink.
5010889~Yogurt gets used in two ways in this simple dinner party-worthy chicken dish: as a tenderizing marinade and mixed with the pan juices to create a rich sauce for serving.
5010890~A spicy spin on the classic side dish. Any leftovers make an excellent omelet filling when paired with turkey and Monterey Jack cheese.
5010891~The herb-and-spice blend would also be terrific with eggplant or lamb.
5010892~To make the prep easier, buy pre-sliced meat and vegetables; they're sold at some Asian markets. If you can't find pre-sliced meat, ask your butcher to slice it for you.
5014155~This dramatic first course won't soon be forgotten. Chunks of sweet lobster meat bound by a shimmering jelly of fennel-and-tarragon-scented lobster stock promises the most pristine lobster salad you'll ever taste.
5010894~These sandwiches would go well with the vegetable and bean chili.
5010895~An update of duck à l'orange, this recipe replaces whole duck with Muscovy duck breasts, and the syrupy orange glaze of yore with a red-wine sauce and tart-sweet candied kumquats.

5010905~Spanish anchovies in vinegar (boquerones) are milder than salted anchovies and have a light pickled taste. They are available in the refrigerated section of some specialty foods stores and online from markys.com.

5010911~During roundups, cowboys once saved any extra coffee for use in cooking, since water was sometimes scarce. The coffee powder in these beans is an adaptation of that. Add some hot buttered flour tortillas and a crisp salad alongside for a terrific meal.
5010912~When kale started to take over the food world, I noticed it was juiced, made into chips, put into smoothies, and even sneaked into chocolate bars. So why not put it in a pasta dish? The nuts in this recipe give the dish another layer of flavor and a nice crunchy texture. The bitter, citrus, crunch, and chili all combine for a unique pasta.
5010913~Over-the-top delicious.
5010914~Lighten up: To reduce the fat and calories in the cod, substitute 1/3 cup light mayonnaise for the 1/2 cup regular mayo called for.
5010915~During hard times, luxury cuts like steaks and chops give way to humbler ones. None are humbler than the oxtail, and all across the country, depression-era cooks made much of it, frequently in soup. Even in these days, when humble cuts have become restaurant menu stars, soup is still a good way to go with oxtails. Simmering them slowly with garlic and vegetables in red wine yields a rich broth and tender, succulent meat, making a lavish feast for us all.

5010924~In Vietnam, little pork patties like this are often grilled over charcoal right on the street and diners sit and eat on (now iconic) little plastic stools. You can serve these patties simply wrapped in the lettuce leaves here, as a snack, or over vermicelli noodles, as a larger meal. Whats non-negotiable? Serve with plenty of herbs and the funky, salty, sour, sweet dipping sauce.

5010957~Indigo's chef and owner is Glenn Chu, who was born in Hawaii and learned to cook from his Chinese grandmother — and by watching Julia Child on television. The result: Eurasian cuisine, which Chu showcases in selections as eclectic as goat cheese wontons with four-fruit sauce, and grilled shrimp with Thai macadamia-nut pesto. The romantic dining room has a tropical-island motif, with ceiling fans, bamboo, and bird-of-paradise.
5010958~A hint of sweetness makes this perfect for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. It's great toasted, too.
5010959~Carena brings an almost Moroccan sensibility to this delicious play of sweet and savory, from the crisp-tender fennel to the orange essences and underlying traces of saffron and raisins.
5010960~For the pesto mixture, executive food editor Kemp M. Minifie switches from pine nuts to pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, and she incorporates flat-leaf parsley in with the basil. To top it all off she adds homemade bread crumbs. It's not quite Italian anymore, but it works.
5010961~This recipe is just one of the countless ways to use preserved lemons.
5010962~Frying ukoy the Bad Saint way is a very active process­—the fritter will blow apart in the oil before you tease it back together. Use a tall pot with plenty of extra room since the oil will bubble vigorously when the mix hits it.

Yet, flavorwise, they relate perfectly in this pasta dish. Add some slivers of red onion, lots of garlic, a kick of red pepper flakes, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a shower of thinly sliced fresh mint and you have a boldly seasoned pasta dish worthy of serving to company yet easy enough for a family meal.
5010978~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5016720~This dish, flavored with achiote seeds, garlic, and spices, is based on chicken pibil, from Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Traditionally, the chicken is baked in banana leaves, but here we've used collard leaves because they are more readily available. They add moisture and a bit of flavor but do not get tender enough to eat.
5010980~If you feel like experimenting, try using cashews or pecans in place of the almonds.

So most of my time is spent either working with patients or writing my dissertation. Still, no matter what's on my schedule, nothing can stop me from going into the kitchen.

On Saturdays, I cook for friends — because next to cooking, sharing the results is my favorite thing to do."""

5011024~Highly recommended!
5011025~Herb-and-bread-crumb coatings are classic on rack of lamb, but leaving out the crumbs lightens the dish (and the juicy chops taste more summery as a result). This recipe is best made with new garlic — garlic that has not been aged. It is covered with a moist membrane rather than papery skin and is often sold with greens attached. If you're lucky enough to find some, substitute 1/4 cup chopped garlic greens for half of the parsley in the herb mixture.

""I really love to cook, so we entertain a lot, and I enjoy planning the dinners as much as I do making them. I tell people the best restaurant in town is our house!

5011044~Way up in Maine, in the coastal town of Blue Hill, is Jonathan's, a small place much favored by locals. Owner Jonathan Chase and chef Richard Hanson both love fish, whether from the sea or from freshwater lakes and streams. This colorful main course is good with buttered and dilled new potatoes. Round out the meal with a green salad, and end with a slice of lattice-topped blueberry pie. (If necessary, have the fishmonger bone the trout, or use four small fillets.)
5011045~Pair this bespoke ketchup with Grilled Rosemary Chicken .
5011046~Here, meltingly rich veal shanks combine wonderfully with the chewiness of orecchiette, ear-shaped pasta shells made of semolina (coarsely ground durum wheat).

5011048~We call this delightful apple and fig custard recipe “dessert for breakfast.”
5011049~The cornbread needs to dry overnight, so start this at least one day ahead.
5011050~In this recipe we call for a 3- by 1 1/2-inch stainless-steel pastry ring. It is available at some specialty cookware shops.
5011051~Though you can certainly buy preserved lemons, we prefer the rich, clean taste of homemade. This technique, adapted from Paula Wolfert's, brings a multidimensional freshness and a wonderfully distinct pungency to the lemons, which are as much a revelation in salads, soups, or even cocktails as they are alongside the grilled fish. There's no need to rinse them first, but do discard the pulp — only the rind is eaten with the grilled sardines.
5011052~"While visiting Lima, Peru, food editor and stylist Paul Grimes, who developed this recipe, ate a dish called ""hot ceviche.""Inspired by the playful concept, he tried something similar in the test kitchen."

5011122~Purslane has long been considered a weed, but it is increasingly showing up for sale in bunches at farmers markets. Meanwhile, Mexicans have known about its healthful properties for hundreds of years and they eat it both raw and cooked. In Mexico it's called verdolagas. Cooking mellows its tang and shrinks it, which means you can eat more of it! Paired with avocado and a tomato relish, this is a super-healthy vegetarian snack or main dish.
5011123~Missing those fried fish tacos you had that one time at a shabby little beach restaurant in Southern California? Or the fish-and-chips from the chipper? Yeah, me too. The nice thing about this recipe is you can fry up a batch easily—no deep-fat fryer required. The batter is made with quinoa flour and gets added texture and crispness from toasted quinoa. Serve the fish as a main dish with whatever side you life, douse it in malt vinegar, or satisfy that California craving and use it to make tacos.

5011130~If your idea of coleslaw is the pleated paper cup of shredded stuff alongside BLTs at the diner, it's time for a new rule: Slaw doesn't go with the sandwich, it goes on the sandwich. Slaws deliver on several fronts. They're crunchy, and sandwiches need crunch. Done right, slaws give a bright acidic kick to counter the fatty goodness of meats and mayo. And they provide a temperature contrast to warm sandwiches, like this fried-chicken masterpiece from Son of a Gun in Los Angeles. We can't think of a sandwich that doesn't deserve slaw, so pile it on.
5011131~This is the kind of healthy, satisfying food that we all wish would simply materialize at home for dinner. But making it in parts is easier than you might think!
5011132~What to drink: Syrah (or Shiraz, as it's called if Australian), or any medium-bodied, fruity red wine.

5011135~"When I was growing up, my mom would cut up fresh fruit and arrange it on a plate with a shot glass full of toothpicks. She would also toss fresh fruit with some orange or lime juice and sugar. Taking inspiration from her, I came up with my own version: lime, lemon, a little maple syrup, and an herb syrup with rosemary or mint.
Cut your fruit into chunks rather than into small pieces; I find that small pieces of fruit get mealy and mushy. Make the salad the morning you're going to serve it, but if you're determined to make it the night before, cut up the fruit, store it in separate containers, and then toss it together in the morning. Use whatever fruit you'd like (bananas, apples, berries—the possibilities are endless), but unless you're using the ripest, sweetest seasonal fruit, add a little sugar."

5011156~Nothing says Christmas quite like a standing beef rib roast. For starters, it's got good bones. And those bones give it stature—there's nothing petite about this hunk of beef—so it is a commanding presence on your holiday table. That other holiday favorite, beef tenderloin, can't begin to compare in brawn or beefiness.

5011158~"This gets a delicious lift from lemon in the butter, in the gravy, and under the skin, plus a shortcut for ""preserved"" lemons."
5011159~The flavorful broth that results from cooking the pork is known in Chinese cuisine as a master sauce — save any that's left over in the freezer and use it for braising other meats, such as duck or chicken. Allowing the pork to cool overnight in the broth ensures its succulence — and because it's made ahead, this dish is ideal for entertaining.

Be sure not to use a pan with a nonstick coating. Because this cake is cooled upside down in the pan, you want the cake to stick to the sides a bit.

5011312~A spectacular gravy begins with pan drippings, but the true flavor base comes from a good stock. The real selling point of this stock is that you can make it way in advance of Thanksgiving. And any leftovers of the stock will enhance the soups and sauces that follow the big feast.
5011180~This luscious, low-fat drink couldn't be easier to make. It has a thick, creamy texture produced by pureeing the frozen berries. No ice cubes necessary.
5011181~Jalebis are small, bright yellow, web-shaped cakes similar to funnel cakes. They are popular celebration and street cakes in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and India. Soaking them in saffron syrup and then drying them gives the cakes a crispy outer shell. They are made with maida flour (a finely milled wheat flour) and Bengal gram flour (a flour milled from chickpeas), both of which can be found at Indian groceries. If you can't find them, use cake or pastry flour. If you can find fresh yeast, use it instead of the dry yeast; that is the traditional method and it adds to the flavor.

Although the carrot flavor is full there, garnishing the soup with carrot greens and finely diced orange and yellow carrots locks the flavor in more firmly. This is an extremely simple soup, intentionally so to underscore the purity of color and flavor. Try making it with pale yellow carrots, too.

My husband and I emigrated from South Africa seven years ago. I am retired from preschool teaching, but I still keep busy by cooking for the family. A typical South African dinner is a barbecue with lots of grilled lamb chops and sausages."""
5011193~Greek yogurt, if you can find it, is incredibly thick and creamy and a delight to eat. It shows up in several guises on the Greek table — as a savory dip, in sauces, or for dessert.
5011194~Highly recommended!
5011195~"I live in New York, where Greek salads are a reliable diner staple. I love the combination of briny Kalamata olives and salty feta cheese mixed with crisp romaine lettuce and refreshing cucumbers.

Our family eats an Irish breakfast or some parts of it at least once a week, and not always in the morning. We're lucky to have great producers of bacon and, of course, black and white pudding, which is a particular specialty of Cork County. Black pudding (blood sausage) may be more popular worldwide, but white pudding is very popular in Ireland and an important part of an Irish breakfast. White pudding is similar to black pudding, but it contains no blood—only pork, spices, and usually oatmeal. I love this big cooked breakfast, but it isn't something I'll eat early in the morning before I go for a run!"

We found that Panda brand black licorice works best in this particular recipe.
5011222~In this simple recipe, an adaptation of Italian cooking legend Marcella Hazan's Bolognese-style pork loin braised in milk, the meat acquires a delicate texture and flavor and the milk slowly evolves into a rich sauce of golden curds. Don't be put off by its homely appearance!
5011223~An omelet can be as delicious plain as filled with an almost endless array of cooked vegetables, cheeses, herbs, smoked meats, fish, and more.

5011234~We love the idea of sharing the top tier of a wedding cake, but eating a dessert that's been frozen for a year can be less than satisfying. This adorable five-inch layer cake was inspired by the romantic tradition—and can be enjoyed right now.

5011237~Cooking a pot of rice is much easier than tearing up and toasting bread for stuffing. Assembling the side dish a day ahead saves time, too.

5011243~Early French gardeners developed the espalier method of growing fruit trees-the trees are trained to grow flat against a wall or trellis-so they could take full advantage of the sun and use small plots of land efficiently. October finds markets full of newly harvested crisp apples that add wonderful flavor to this traditional French tart.
5011244~A good roast chicken is one of my favorite things to cook and eat. Every cook should know how to roast a chicken properly. The stuffing in this recipe contains a fantastic Middle Eastern spice blend called za'atar, which is a combination of sesame seeds and dried herbs such as basil, thyme and oregano.
5012675~These biscotti are equally delicious made with roasted almonds, pecans, or hazelnuts in place of the cashews.
5011246~Apple juice and dried blueberries bring subtle sweetness to the filling. Like your desserts sweeter? Add one or two tablespoons of sugar.
5011247~"You know the Juicy Lucy, right? It's a cheese-stuffed burger that was born in Minneapolis in the 1950s, and legend has it that it got its name when the first patron took a bite and exclaimed, ""That's one juicy lucy!"" Well, my friend Erin Meister, who blogs as The Nervous Cook, sent me her take on it: a marinated portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a runny-yolk egg. A total umami bomb and, like the Juicy Lucy, a mess to eat. But when you're cooking for yourself who cares if you have egg on your face? Erin marinates the mushroom in a miso-vinegar mixture, but since I usually have Sesame Miso Vinaigrette on hand, it's perfect to use here, too. If you don't have it, substitute 1 tablespoon of white miso in 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar. If you don't have a grill, don't sweat it; you won't get the smoky tinge, but this works just fine instead, using a cast-iron skillet or grill pan fitted with a lid (or aluminum foil)."
5011248~Gently spiced pecans and a salty caramel topping give this morning treat a savory dimension.
5011249~Serve the chicken with steamed rice to soak up the delicious sauce.
5011250~Goes great with: Salad of butter lettuce, radicchio, roasted pears, and toasted walnuts. What to drink: Red Burgundy or Pinot Gris.
5011251~A sophisticated—and infinitely easier—take on sour cream and onion dip. Pair it with lamb, grilled chicken, or fish.
5019962~Chicken stock is one of the great all-purpose kitchen preparations, and you’ll be surprised at how useful it is in chowder making. It is unsurpassed as a vehicle for soups and stews, providing nutrients, a luxuriant texture, and a delicious flavor. I am always amazed at how the flavor of chicken stock melts into other flavors and allows them to come through clearly. That’s why it is staple ingredient in most any culture’s soups.
5011253~Highly recommended!
5011254~You can cook the chickpeas a day or two in advance; pick up at the step where you sauté the onion and garlic.
5011255~Highly recommended!
5011256~If you've ever wanted to eat pie like a cookie, these pie bar cookies are for you. The bright berry filling and buttery, flaky crust make them totally irresistible.
5011257~We're seeing gigante beans everywhere. They're creamy and buttery, and their size adds a dramatic look.
5011258~Not a mayo maker? Season your favorite brand with vinegar and hot sauce to bump up the tang and add heat.
5011259~This vegetarian take on a traditional Mexican red pozole—pozole being the name not only of a type of stew, often made with pork, but also of the large dried corn kernels (hominy) integral to the mixture—is rich and satisfying. The accompaniments are an essential and fun part of the dish, adding some fresh crunch to the toothsome bite of hominy, beans, and vegetables. It's the perfect meal to have waiting on the back of the stove for family and friends as they straggle in from near and far for a holiday weekend.
5011260~"Trout cooked this way is called müllerin, ""the miller's wife's"" fish, because it's made from filets of mountain trout fished from the stream that powers the flour mill. It is precisely the same preparation and derivation as the French meunière. Don't be fooled by its apparent simplicity: layers of flavor are built by each ingredient in its turn—it is elegant in its simplicity. The trout filets are lightly coated with flour, browned in a pan with good butter, and by the time the fish is cooked, the butter has turned nutty brown and the fish is crisp and tender. Just before serving, a squeeze of lemon and freshly chopped parsley turn the butter in the pan into bubbly foam which is then spooned over each filet."
5011261~Accompany this robust salad with crusty bread and serve grapes for dessert.
5011262~This recipe was created to accompany Grilled Chicken with Peach and Apple Salsa.
5011263~The egg makes these a little less delicate (and less likely to break) than traditional lace cookies. Arrange them in a decorative box or tin lined with festive tissue paper, then secure the package with a fancy bow.
5011264~Hash has never been so decadent. Pieces of duck confit, tender vegetables, and golden-brown potatoes meld with a lavish drizzle of heavy cream and Madeira to create a breakfast centerpiece.
5011265~Dried porcini are sold at Italian delis and in many supermarkets.
5011266~Everybody knows now that the undisputed king of mangoes is the Indian Alphonso. It is intensely sweet and has an unbeatable perfumed aroma. I'd go as far as saying that you haven't tasted a real mango until you've tried an Alphonso (and nobody is paying me for this). The season, though, is very short—mid-April to the end of May—so try to prepare this salad then.

5011274~In this side dish, the veggies are cooked until just tender to retain their fresh-from-the-market flavor. For a delicious finishing touch, a handful of sliced basil is stirred in right before serving.
5011275~Baker's sugar, a favorite of pastry chefs, is also called superfine sugar. It measures the same as regular but dissolves more quickly. It's available at some supermarkets. You can also make your own by whizzing granulated sugar in a food processor until powdery.

5011300~Wrapped with bacon, these delicious fillets self-baste during broiling, eliminating the need for a sauce.
5011301~Beating the butter and sugar properly (read thoroughly) gives these mini cakes lift, but they will still be moist and marzipan-y in the center.
5011302~Make the most of apricot season while it lasts. Matching the fruit with mustard and pork is one of the best ways to enjoy it.

5011306~Don't be scared of soufflé! Make the base super flavorful and moist by stirring in a jam or jelly, then help it rise with a properly whipped French meringue. Whip the eggs until just medium firm so they have more room to expand in the oven and help the soufflé rise.
5019938~Vegan (when made with agave nectar or sugar)
5011308~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional sitting time.
5011309~You can roast a chicken in less time, but going low-and-slow yields a meltingly tender, shreddable texture.
5016888~Salty, crunchy bites, tasting of the sea, complement the lobster gelées' delicate, melting texture.
5011311~"""For a dinner with company, I often pop these in the oven with a roast, then serve them on dressed mixed greens as an appetizer,"" writes Elsie Wollaston of Vancouver, Canada. ""I also like to serve them directly from the ramekins as a brunch dish."""
5011312~A spectacular gravy begins with pan drippings, but the true flavor base comes from a good stock. The real selling point of this stock is that you can make it way in advance of Thanksgiving. And any leftovers of the stock will enhance the soups and sauces that follow the big feast.
5011313~Highly recommended!
5017409~Agave nectar, a product of the agave plant better known as the source of tequila, blends beautifully with Old World Spanish sherry for a gentle sweet-and-sour glaze and luscious gravy. Because agave nectar has a low glycemic index, it's the new darling of the health-conscious crowd who are trying to lower their sugar intake. Although making the brown turkey stock for the gravy is an extra step, it can be done weeks ahead and frozen, and it's the secret behind a truly memorable gravy.

5011323~Highly recommended!
5011324~The Irish are famous for their smoked salmon, so it's a natural for a St. Patrick's Day party. Of course, you don't have to use Irish smoked salmon for these toasts; any coldsmoked salmon will work well, but if you're feeling flush, you will be treating yourself to salmon that is supersilky in texture with a distinct smokiness that comes from spending time near smoldering hardwoods such as oak and beechwood. If topping your salmon with anything other than a gentle squeeze of lemon seems like heresy, don't knock our tangysweet malt vinegar syrup until you've tried it. You just might get hooked.
5011325~One great thing about this lasagna is that the noodles don't need to be pre-boiled. The dish has a lot of liquid (in the form of sauce) and goes into the oven covered, so the noodles get cooked perfectly as the lasagna bakes. Add a green salad, and serve some Chianti or California red Zinfandel with the main course.
5011326~Turkish cooking might sound exotic, but it's easy. Most of the ingredients are familiar, and combining them in new ways makes for an exciting and different way to eat. This is an excellent side salad for lamb chops. For a great small-plates dinner party menu that's modern Turkish cooking at its best, pick up the May issue of Bon Appétit.
5011327~"If there is any ""magic"" to our cooking, it's in seasoning mixes such as this. With this mixture, we try to unmask the depth of flavor in our native seafood, not overpower it. We want every bite to display a full flavor profile, so we liberally sprinkle seasoning on the entire piece of fish. That means both sides. Make a decent-sized batch of this mixture so it will always be handy, then rub it or sprinkle it on the food. Remember, mixtures such as this cost very little to make yourself but quite a lot if you buy them at retail."
5013830~"Espagnole is a classic brown sauce, typically made from brown stock, mirepoix, and tomatoes, and thickened with roux. Given that the sauce is French in origin, where did the name come from? According to Alan Davidson, in The Oxford Companion to Food, ""The name has nothing to do with Spain, any more than the counterpart term allemande has anything to do with Germany. It is generally believed that the terms were chosen because in French eyes Germans are blond and Spaniards are brown."""
5011329~This crumbly shortbread is studded with dried currants, which are tiny raisins made from Zante grapes. The currants must be soaked overnight, so you'll need to plan your craving a day in advance.
5011330~"In the 1600s, ""flapjack"" referred to a thick pancake that was cooked on a skillet and turned by being tossed (flapped). By the 1930s, it had come to mean a biscuit like this, made from rolled oats, syrup and butter--sort of the granola bars of their day. They're the perfect thing to have with a cup of tea or coffee."
5012631~This recipe requires a little advance planning — the yogurt will need to drain for at least 8 hours.
5011332~Sweet and savory meet with delicious results in this elegant tart.
5011333~Like most little kids, Dahlia loves macaroni and cheese, and I've made it for her in many guises, running the gamut of techniques. My aim is always the same—to make the dish quickly with a minimum of fuss, and to use a maximum of vegetables that she will tolerate and not pick out.
5011334~Serve this slightly sweet soup as a cooling first course or a light dessert.

5011340~Have the butcher bone the turkey, providing two boned breasts and two boned leg-thigh pieces. Each should weigh about 1 1/2 pounds. Save the bones for turkey stock.
5011341~"Want cookies in a flash? These butterscotch ""buttons"" come together fast and don't require an oven, which means you can have a treat any time you want it."
5011342~While entertaining guests, the Earl of Grantham might perhaps offer a bit of hunting—should the weather permit. Although fowl such as pheasants or wild game like hare might be preferred, should a guest kill a mallard or some other duck, it would not go to waste. Mrs. Patmore could certainly use the duck in a fine recipe such as this one to offer the guests a taste of their own hunting prowess.
5011343~Highly recommended!
5020015~Use a leftover baguette to make these crostini; they will keep well in an airtight container for a week.
5011345~Turkey soup may be the end of the line for turkey leftovers, but it doesn't have to be boring and predictable. The hearty essence of the roasted holiday bird is concentrated into a deeply satisfying broth, thick with noodles and laced with garlic, rosemary, and tomatoes. This is a guaranteed crowd pleaser whether it's just the family or a last minute gathering of friends. And thanks to the ready availability of turkey wings, executive food editor Kemp M. Minifie bets you won't want to wait until next Thanksgiving to make it again.
5011346~This piquant Indian marinade adds depth of flavor to the sturgeon's meaty white flesh.
5011347~"""At Linger, we make jam with miso. It's delicious with pork but is especially tasty on bread with cream cheese."""
5011348~Spicy, sharp turnip greens, braised gently with a smoked ham hock, are a time-honored accompaniment on southern tables at any time of the year. Add in the turnips, plus lots of apple, and the dish tastes lighter and more delicate. It's also very pretty, with the ivory turnips, golden apple, and pink ham nestled among the dark greens.
5011349~Scandinavians simply adore black licorice; the selection available in their grocery stores rivals that of chocolate bars in ours. But you don't have to be crazy about it to enjoy this pudding, which is wonderfully smooth and tantalizingly tinged with molasses and anise. We found that Panda brand black licorice works best in this particular recipe.
5017656~You can prepare the polenta a day ahead. The chicken and vegetables can be made earlier in the day, and both can be reheated before serving. Team this with a radicchio and arugula salad, and uncork a Pinot Grigio.
5011351~Highly recommended!
5011352~Vietnamese-style rolls are a great addition to your summer repertoire: They require very little cooking and can be assembled at the kitchen table or out on the patio. Thanks to bean thread noodles and baked tofu, they make a substantial meal, but pickled vegetables and a trio of herbs keep each sauce-dipped bite light and cool.
5011353~Noodle kugels, or baked puddings, abound in Ashkenazic Jewish cookery, and this particular version makes an outstanding dessert or brunch dish. You'll find that the mild sweetness of coarsely grated Gala apples perks up the hearty richness.

5011362~White miso might sound like the kind of ingredient that sends you in search of a specialty store, but in fact it is the most common type of miso paste, and you're likely to find it in the international or Asian food section of the supermarket. It's a lighter, sweeter alternative to dark miso, which is generally used in soup, and it often appears in dressings like the one for this easy Japanese noodle salad.

5011376~Here's a beautiful, easy main course. It goes well with a fennel and orange salad with olives and orange vinaigrette, the couscous , a sauté of spinach and pine nuts, and an Oregon Pinot Noir. For the finale, top purchased baklava with whipped cream that has been mixed with a touch of ground cardamom.
5011377~You would never guess by tasting these robust sandwiches that they are low in fat and calories. The secret is spread made of low-fat mayonnaise, nonfat yogurt, Dijon mustard and chopped arugula.
5011378~Rice sticks turn up in soups in many parts of Asia. This recipe was inspired by an aromatic soup offered at Bo Ky, a Vietnamese noodle parlor on Bayard Street in New York City.
5011379~The swirly meringue topping on this pie is stable enough to make a day ahead and keep chilled—even if you've bruleed it.

5017352~Highly recommended!
5011387~In classic Chinese cooking, noodles destined for soup are cooked separately and added at the last minute so that the starch from the pasta doesn't cloud the broth. Because we were aiming for a rib-sticking dish, we broke with tradition and cooked the noodles right in the stock, allowing the starch to thicken the soup slightly.

Flavored with plenty of garlic and ginger and brushed with a sweet-and-savory soy glaze, these meatballs are a great defense of ground chicken, which can be bland if not seasoned well.

5011399~This stress-free dish is based on one of my favorite flavor pairings—golden roast chicken and tarragon. The chicken is simply seared on the cooktop, then placed in the oven to bake with zingy lemon, garlic, fresh fennel and tarragon for just 25 minutes. That's dinner, done!
5011400~Highly recommended!
5011401~The halibut is brined briefly in salt water, which seasons it all the way through.
5011402~This cashew, pine nut, and walnut tart is reminiscent of a pecan pie, but caramel sauce stands in for the cornsyrup filling. Serve with dollops of freshly whipped cream.

It can be portioned into 8 ramekins or steamed in a large bowl and turned out as a whole cake. If you're using the ramekins, rather than spooning in the batter, you may want to transfer it to a large pastry bag and pipe it in—this will keep things neat and produce evenly proportioned cakes.

5017547~Here's a perfect side dish for the hectic holidays. You can cook the brussels sprouts one day ahead; cool them under cold running water, then drain, cover and refrigerate.
5011428~The play of shapes and shades of green in this vegetable combo takes the humdrum out of these supermarket standbys. Lemon zest adds just the right zip of citrus, but unlike a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, it won't turn the greens an unappealing khaki shade.
5011429~Serve on a bed of lettuce with dill sprigs and sliced ripe tomatoes or pile onto whole wheat bread with crisp lettuce for a satisfying sandwich.
5011430~Editor's note: Serve these beans with Suzanne Goin's Beef Brisket with Slow-Roasted Romano Beans and Black Olive Aïoli .
5011431~Don't be nervous about making meatless mincemeat if you've never tried it before—it's a knockout combination of dried fruits and spices that adds wonderfully deep flavor to baked goods. Here, chunks of sweet pear and a handful of tart fruit create a pie that's fantastic with vanilla ice cream.
5011432~This dish is one of my favorites for the grill. If a fish comes whole from the store, leave the head and tail on when you cook it, to help retain moisture. The fish is done when the inside of the stomach is dry.

5014682~We get a little weak-kneed with delight around cakes, particularly cakes whimsically shaped to look like something else—in this case, a Yule log. Made famous in France as Bûches de Noël, these sheet cakes, filled, rolled, and frosted to look like the trunks of trees, complete with the stumps of sawed off branches, provide creative cooks the very real opportunity to play with their food. Want a few woodsy meringue mushrooms made from meringue to continue the conceit? Why not?

5011461~When the Italian fashion brand Trussardi opened their sprawling flagship store across from La Scala, Milan’s historic opera house, they strategically included a ground-floor café to revitalize weary shoppers. As any serious fashionista knows, nothing helps one pull the trigger when wavering over a new handbag or pair of cufflinks like a little liquid encouragement. At Trussardi Café, bartender Tommaso Cecca has not only transformed the brand’s fragrances into aromatic cocktails, but made his own twists on Italian classics, such as the Americano. Replacing soda water with a beer float makes for a frothy, refreshing cocktail. For a lighter, more floral version of this cocktail, Cecca uses dry white vermouth, Weizen or wheat beer, and a lemon peel as garnish. To achieve Trussardi-worthy froth at home, try using an Aerolatte, a mini whisk-blender more commonly used to prepare milk foam for a cappuccino.

5014161~The original Manhattan, created in 1874 at the Manhattan Club in New York, was made with sweet vermouth and rye, which produces a smooth, mellow, cocktail. Over time, multiple variations of the Manhattan have developed, with tweaks to both the whiskey and the vermouth, so that today you can have a classic sweet Manhattan, made with only sweet vermouth; a dry Manhattan, made with only dry vermouth; or a perfect Manhattan, made with equal amounts of both. And as bourbon has become increasingly popular over the last few decades, it has found its way into the Manhattan in the place of the rye whiskey, giving a richer cocktail more bite and a hint of smokiness. Make yours according to your taste — sweet, dry, or perfect — and with either bourbon or rye. No matter what style you prefer, don't be afraid to use the bitters, as they make the drink fuller and more flavorful.

Don't be put off by the long list of ingredients — we promise you won't be disappointed if you make the sauce from scratch.

The meat can be marinated and the sauce prepared ahead, so you just need to grill the satés before serving.

Since it doesn't taste like much (nice texture, though), it's all about the supporting cast as far as delivering flavor goes. And in this version there's such a big cast that you can lose one or two items and the salad will still taste real good. You can even lose the papaya (shhhh) and make it with all the other goodies. Just don't lose the fish sauce, palm sugar, lime juice, or chili—deal?

5011680~"Susan Murphy of Kansas City, Missouri, writes: ""My daughter and I love to spruce up boxed cake mixes with spices, nuts, or fruit. One afternoon we decided to experiment with banana muffin mix instead. We made a very moist cake, filled it with fresh banana slices, then topped it with creamy homemade frosting. It's one of our favorite creations to date."""

5011702~Hazelnuts and prosciutto are combined in a seasoned butter that coats the turkey as it roasts, and also flavors the gravy.
5011703~Every trick in the barbecue kit is used to create this incredible dish: a spice rub for deep-down flavor, a mop to keep the chicken moist during cooking, wood chips for old-fashioned smoke taste, and, of course, a delicious sauce that features root beer. Using root beer is a great idea since it is sweet and aromatic—qualities you expect in barbecue sauce. Ask your butcher to halve the chickens and remove the backbones.

5011736~Maytag Blue cheese, made by the same family that became world famous for its appliances, is handmade from cow's milk and has a peppery, piquant flavor. Start this sandwich about an hour in advance so the chicken has time to marinate. This is an easy recipe to double or triple for a larger group, and the chicken can be made ahead. I like to serve this sandwich on raisin pumpernickel bread, but feel free to use another favorite loaf.

5011739~"Lindsay McDougal of Corona, California, writes: ""When my husband and I first moved to Southern California from a small town between Edinburgh and Glasgow, we were amazed by the variety of foods available. It's almost unfair to compare the two places, since there are so many different ethnic cuisines here. We've come to love Mexican and Italian cooking, but we still find ourselves yearning for the traditional Scottish recipes we grew up with, like Scotch eggs and meat and potato pies. They're hearty dishes and so easy to make."""
5011740~The burger's undeniable appeal and infinite flexibility have inspired culinary luminaries like Bobby Flay and Laurent Tourondel to devote entire restaurants to the humble sandwich. And despite what purists might say, some of todays best burgers aren't even made with beef. Patties made of lamb, bison, or seafood (like the crab burgers here) are increasingly popular. Toasted bread, a pita pocket, or even a lettuce leaf are fun standins for the traditional bun. In our homage to the modern burger, the crab patties are served open-face with a spicy red pepper dressing.

5011748~Traditional pot stickers, complete with fresh dough and the requisite number of pleats, are best saved for a special occasion. This version, made with store–bought wonton wrappers, is easy enough for a weeknight meal. A flavorful filling of ground chicken and celery (left over from Sage Stuffing) is seasoned with sesame oil and soy sauce and enclosed within the simply folded wonton—no pleats involved. We do cook the pot stickers the conventional way, by first frying them and then steaming them until the water evaporates and the bottoms are crisp and golden. It is imperative to use dark chicken meat (from legs and thighs) because it doesn't dry out the way leaner white meat can.

5011786~"Most chefs don't focus on salads. Maybe that's how ""chefs salad"" came to mean a pile of iceberg lettuce topped with bits of cheese, strips of cold cuts, and wedges of hard-boiled eggs. But with all the fantastic American cheeses and locally produced charcuterie available today, it's time to put the ""chef"" back in the chef's salad. It doesn't take long to arrange the meats and cheeses atop a bed of interesting greens, then whip up our quince dressing, drizzle—and dine."
5011787~This ticks all the boxes for a healthy dessert. The mixture of oats, almonds, berries, dates, and cinnamon creates the perfect sustained energy-releasing treat that packs a hefty nutritional punch.

5011797~Although legend has it that the red velvet cake originated in the early 1900s at New York City's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, it's been a Southern favorite for as long as I can remember. (A friend of mine recently reported seeing a version of it at a Starbucks in Mississippi.) Years ago, I made an armadillo-shaped red velvet cake for a wedding couple, complete with gray cream cheese icing for the animal's shell and scales. The idea may have come from the popular 1989 movie Steel Magnolias, which featured a red velvet armadillo groom's cake, a popular Southern tradition that continues to this day. The inspiration for my red velvet cupcakes came from my high-school boyfriend's grandmother. My mother was quite ill during those years, so I spent a lot of time with Bob Yarborough's family. His Birmingham, Alabama–born grandmother cooked and baked frequently, and I never forgot her red velvet cake. I wrote the instructions in my high-school recipe notebook and used it as a guide for developing these cupcakes. The mint extract and crushed mint candies add bit of holiday flair, but easily can be left out at other times of the year.

5011904~This version of aglio e olio (garlic and oil) sauce includes anchovies, red pepper flakes, and freshly toasted breadcrumbs, which add great flavor and a little crunch.
5011905~The garlic-nut sauce known as tarator, which sometimes also includes tahini, is a classic Turkish accompaniment to mussels and fried fish as well as vegetables. Here, it's used with cauliflower that is sliced — rather than separated into florets — so that it can be more easily browned, which gives it a nutty flavor that complements the tarator perfectly.

5011909~Sautéed radishes give a nice kick to this dish, an easy version of fajitas.
5011910~The brisket and short ribs are simmered, then roasted, which makes the meat tender on the inside and crusty and brown on the outside. The celery root, rutabagas, and potatoes are cooked in the leftover broth from the meats, which results in a wonderfully rich, flavorful mash.
5011911~Ginger and garlic give these pea pods a hint of Asian flavor, but we think they're a good all-purpose side dish.

5019226~The original cornmeal batters, as made for the settlers by the Indians, consisted of cornmeal, salt and water. These simple batters quickly evolved to include eggs, butter and milk, and were the basis of many of the most celebrated Early American breads, cakes and puddings.
5011926~Although butter always works well with asparagus, horseradish adds a little kick. Halving the stalks saves time in the oven.
5011927~Tart and fiery, this classic bright-green salsa shows off the flavor of tomatillos and the lovable grassy sharpness of fresh unripe chiles. Serve it with anything that would benefit from lively contrast, such as Chopped Fried-Fish Tacos .

In this recipe the carrots may be cooked separately in boiling salted water until tender for a brighter color. Lentilles du Puy (French green lentils) are available at specialty foods shops and some natural foods stores.
5011939~Sunday breakfast. From Miraval Resort & Spa in Catalina, Arizona. Egg-white omelettes don't have to taste like quilt batting. Chefs at Miraval whip up a fluffy, veggie-heavy number. Their secret? A dollop of lowfat cream cheese, which improves the texture and adds a rich taste.

5011974~Boneless top round roast is a cut taken from the flavorful leg. Here, we sliced it across the grain into steaks that are grilled and served with a Mediterranean-inspired combination of artichoke hearts, olives, and fire-roasted tomatoes.
5011975~A bâtarde is a loaf of bread that is slightly thicker but shorter than a baguette. This version gets nice texture and flavor from cooked wild rice. Be sure to cook and cool the rice before making the bread.
5011976~This combination of rich smoky ham, tangy mustard, melty cheese, and ripe tomato is perfect for a lavish breakfast with a fried egg or served with a bowl of soup.
5011977~If it makes sense sometimes to eat breakfast for dinner, why not breakfast for dessert? These pancakes are perfect for the fall, when apples are in season and gingerbread spices are on the mind. My apple of choice is the Golden Delicious because when cooked, it becomes honeyed and intense, but you can use any apple that holds its shape. Don't try this with McIntosh; they disintegrate into mush.
5011978~Inspired by a recipe from chef Kaori Endo of Nanashi in Paris, this smart, easy dessert shows how well matcha plays with creamy yogurt and fruit.
5011979~A staple of Milanese cuisine, polenta is delicious here teamed with tomatoes and spinach, two other ingredients typical of the Lombardy region. The combination of Parmesan and Gruyère cheeses adds richness to the dish. If you prefer, the eggs in the center can be replaced with more spinach. Simply sauté ten ounces of fresh spinach leaves in one tablespoon olive oil, then divide the spinach among the cups. Serve these with Dolcetto d'Alba, a mild red wine from the neighboring Piedmont region.

5011999~At the Perryville Inn chef Paul Ingenito uses the succulent bits of meat from lobster knuckles in a bread pudding, which he bakes and serves in empty lobster tail shells as an adjunct to a whole lobster. We thought the pudding was stunning enough to stand on its own and so adapted the recipe, using the meat of a whole lobster for the pudding and the shells and body for the sauce.
5012000~Complete the menu with a tomato and red onion salad, sourdough bread, and poached pears (or canned) with raspberry sauce.
5012001~I realize that this seems almost too simple to mention, but it is such a perfect dish, and a good solution to a high-summer extravagance of zucchini and mint. And unlike some pasta dishes, it is light enough for a first course. I grate an additional bit of lemon zest over the finished dish.
5012002~After a heavy meal, we look for recipes that double as a palate cleanser, with spice, zing, and freshness. With some vegetables that, you know, still have some crunch.
5012003~We transformed the regular hands-on skillet method to a very hands-off oven technique.

5012009~If you're craving an aromatic Chinatown-style noodle soup, this recipe is a quick fix — especially if you use a roast chicken from the supermarket deli. (For another variation, try using roast duck from a Chinese deli instead.) The chrysanthemum leaves are a beautiful match with the delicate broth redolent of star anise, but watercress can be substituted if you like.

5012014~Clafouti is a rustic, simple French dessert that's a cross between a pancake and a custard. You can use other fruits, but cherries are traditional — and this is the month they're at their best.
5012015~"The juices from any roast—poultry or meat—caramelize in the pan, leaving a residue of brown glaze with intense flavor. In the process called ""deglazing,"" we melt these brown bits in hot liquid (wine, stock, and/or water), to create a quick sauce of concentrated natural essences. Make this pan sauce for either of our roast chickens."
5012016~Assemble these four hours ahead, and rewarm them 20 minutes before serving.
5012017~Glutinous rice is distinctively aromatic and appealingly chewy. Before being steamed, it requires at least 3 hours of soaking (overnight is fine, too).
5012018~Sometimes baby back ribs are sold in sections of four to six ribs rather than as whole racks; those will also work here. Begin preparing the ribs a day before serving so that they can chill overnight after the spice rub has been applied.
5013048~"""Four-spices"" usually include four of five spices and are commonly used to season forcemeats for sausages and terrines. I include all five.

Vary the amounts to suit your own palate."

5012025~"The best leftover dish is the first sandwich you make from what's left of the turkey, standing barefoot in a quiet kitchen lighted only by the dim bulb above the stove: thick toast with mayo and cranberry sauce and dressing and slices of just-carved meat.
No, scratch that (though it's delicious and you should make two or three). The best leftover recipe is risotto with turkey and wild mushrooms, the grains of rice plump with turkey broth and made nutty with cheese. The soft richness of the meal recalls Thanksgiving, then amplifies the memory, giving it a rakish flair."

5012027~These delicious cookies are decorated with a sprinkling of raw sugar.
5012028~"The recipe for this quick, fresh cheese from Mozza chef Nancy Silverton should be a part of every cook's repertoire. It calls for only four ingredients and takes just 30 minutes to make. While it's not technically ricotta (Italian for ""recooked"") because it's not made by reheating whey (the liquid left over from making mozzarella), it boasts a fresher flavor and creamier texture than the stuff in your supermarket dairy aisle."

5012033~This was the first main-course dish to be offered at The Silver Palate shop, and the distinctive colors and flavors of the prunes, olives, and capers have kept it a favorite for years. It's good hot or at room temperature. When prepared with small drumsticks and wings, it makes a delicious appetizer.

5012035~Over the Fourth of July weekend in 1924, a group of unexpected guests arrived at Caesar’s Palace restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico. Running low on food, the owner, Caesar Cardini, threw together a salad with ingredients he had on hand. He made a thick dressing with a coddled egg, garlic-flavored oil, lemon juice, grated cheese and Worcestershire, which added a taste of anchovy. This dip has all the flavors of that first Caesar salad, and romaine lettuce and fresh veggies are nice “dippers.”
5012036~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012037~While this calls for four herbs, just one or two—rosemary and thyme, for example—would be fine.
5012038~This smoky blush cocktail features Cappelletti, a Campari-like aperitif that shares its ruby red color but is slightly less sweet and not quite as bitter.
5012039~This fricassee couldn't be more French, but its velvety sauce carries the flavor of vadouvan, a South Indian spice blend that has started to crop up on Parisian menus. We find it irresistible.

5012046~With the galette, offer radicchio tossed with black olives, toasted walnuts and a Sherry vinaigrette. Spoon some stewed rhubarb over vanilla ice cream to top off the meal.
5012047~This herb lends an unexpected hint of mint to bean dishes. For a change, feel free to swap in lowfat feta for the olives.
5012048~Braising leeks brings out their buttery texture. Serve them alongside broiled fish or roast chicken.
5012049~Inspired by classic Greek flavors, this warm salad is balanced with zesty lemon and feta and sweet tender salmon and spring vegetables.

5012056~Squid is popular all over the Mediterranean; it's especially good in this tangy dish, which is nice as an appetizer. If you would like it to be less tart, just stir in a little extra olive oil before serving.
5012057~Lime zest is a fresh addition to macaroons, and a Microplane is our zesting tool of choice. If you can't find unsweetened coconut chips, use two 7-ounce bags of sweetened shredded coconut and reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon.
5017153~In the past two years, half of our food editors have traveled to Spain, where they tried a variety of croquetas (ham, fish, and vegetable) that left a very positive impression. Serve these potato croquetas with any combination of dried sausage, olives, nuts, and cheese.

5012061~Dried chipotle chiles become smoky-hot packages for a filling made from subtly sweet ripe plantains. Don'erestimate the heat of dried chiles—it's important to wear rubber gloves when working with them, since they can be just as potent as fresh ones.

5012063~This take on a Roman vignole showcases the best and brightest of the season's bounty.
5012064~"When we were first dating, we would stay up in bed for hours trying to come up with new interpretations of classic desserts. Bird chile and passion fruit pavlova; Stilton mousse with walnut Florentine; apple, currant, and Brie pot pie. But some classics we knew not to amp up with ""bold flavors"" because they were sacred. Such is the tarte bourdaloue. This was one of the first desserts Matt and I were both taught to make in our classical pastry training; it is the pride of any French patisserie worth its (artisinal) salt, and you will treat it with some goddamn respect! Traditionally, it's a buttery tart crust filled with poached pear and luxurious almond cream. However, no matter how mind blowing the tarte bourdaloue is, almost no one in this country knows what it is."
5012065~Buy steaks that are at least 1 1/4 inches thick; that way, they can be seared without getting overdone. The Mediterranean-flavored butter adds a great taste accent. Also offer mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli, and drink a Burgundy or Pinot Noir.
5012066~This light fish entrée gets a flavor boost from a citrus glaze made from fresh lemon juice, orange juice, and fresh ginger. For stronger, more acidic flavor, add lemon zest and additional juice. Make sure to use a high-quality 100 percent orange juice that is freshly squeezed (not from concentrate).
5012067~Tart, refreshing lime balances the richness of the chocolate.
5012068~Bursting with the big, brash flavors of green olives, anchovies, and capers, this herbaceous pasta sauce isn't afraid to bite back.

5012077~Highly recommended!
5012078~Cutting the pork is easiest using a cleaver or large chef's knife: Slice thick crosswise pieces, stack them, and then cut matchstick-size pieces.
5012079~"""Since we live in a town where there are plenty of apple orchards, my husband and I enjoy developing new dishes that include apples,"" says Lidian Long of Tehachapi, California. ""We particularly like this recipe—he loves its curry flavor, and I appreciate its simplicity."""
5012080~This would be a hot contender for South Africa's national dish! The recipe was selected for an international recipe book published in 1951 by the United Nations Organisation. Bobotie is a Cape-Malay creation, and they spice it up even more with cumin, coriander and cloves. A similar dish was known in Europe in the middle ages after the Crusaders had brought turmeric from the East. When our first Dutch settlers arrived, Holland was largely influenced by Italian cooks, and a favorite dish was a hashed meat backed with curried sauce, spiked with red pepper and 'sweetened with blanched almonds.' There are many local variations, but the idea is that the mince should be tender and creamy in texture, which means long, slow cooking. Early cooks added a little tamarind water; lemon rind and juice is a more modern adaptation.
5012081~Highly recommended!
5012082~The raita — a type of Indian yogurt sauce — makes a terrific dip for the rolls. A cilantro raita seemed right for this global menu because cilantro is one of the most widely used herbs in the world.
5012083~Delicately flavored avocado oil can lose its personality when heated; pour a touch of the oil over food just before serving.
5012084~Highly recommended!
5012085~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5012086~Full of garden vegetables and pasta, this soup relies on a bright basil-and-parsley-based sauce (the pistou) for a last-minute explosion of herbal flavor.
5012087~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Paula Wolfert's book The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen. Wolfert also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.

5012090~Be sure to use only silken tofu in this dish. It's sold in shelf-stable packages, likely near the Asian foods in your grocery store.
5012091~Roast chicken or smoked turkey can step in for the pork, or meat can be omitted entirely for a great side dish. The roasting can be done all at once or in stages. This dish can also be served hot.
5012092~Highly recommended!
5012093~Fresh herbs and pancetta (Italian cured bacon) blanket the pork before it goes into the oven. Ask the butcher to tie the two loins to hold their shape.

5012096~These spiced-packed pickles are the perfect combination of tart and sweet, great for pre-dinner snacking or to top a sandwich. Yellow squash is delicious, but the brine also works well with cucumbers, zucchini, onions, or mushrooms.
5012097~In case you shy away from the pork-fat dressing of the classic frisee, you can always turn to this lighter, but equally delicious version, which substitutes crackling salmon skin for the lardons. Broiled salmon skin is a sushi bar staple, and the ginger in this dish echoes that connection. And further interest is provided by a very sympathetic dose of sherry vinegar. A multi-culti triumph!
5012098~Martha mastered this classic dish during the couple's time in Italy. It's still one of her favorite recipes.
5012099~Here's a warming drink for a chilly day.

5012105~This homemade yogurt works well as a dairy-free alternative. We prefer making our own coconut milk over using canned—the flavor is much more fresh. To reuse the pressed coconut, dry it out in a low oven until no longer moist, then use in baked goods or sprinkle over yogurt.
5012106~The combination of plums and red wine gives this sorbet a stunning fuchsia color and a deep, fruit-filled flavor. Think of it as fruity mulled wine that's been frozen into a refreshing dessert.
5012107~No matter how fast you prepare Thanksgiving dinner, you must have gravy, and you must have stuffing. And both need homemade turkey stock. This one is fast, even with the time it takes to brown the giblets, neck, and wing tips. You can mostly ignore it while it simmers, but you wont be able to deny its enriching, ennobling presence in your finished gravy and stuffing.
5012108~This refreshing dessert comes from Lincoln Carson, pastry chef at the Highlands Inn in Carmel Highlands, California. It has a lovely rich texture, even though it has no eggs.
5012109~"Gemma Sanita Sciabica of Modesto, California, writes: ""My husband's family produces olive oil, and I'm the company's recipe developer.

5012113~Crisp baby radishes, blanched snow peas and mini rice cakes make a light starter. The salad tastes even better with cold Asian beer to wash it down. For dessert, crumble coconut macaroons over orange sorbet.
5012114~This clubby Scotch drink was created at the old Waldorf Astoria in New York City.
5012115~We love hash browns for their delicious contradiction—the way the outer crunch of skillet–fried potatoes gives way to an inner creaminess. Throw in some nuggets of spicy Spanish chorizo (left over from Corn–Bread and Chorizo Stuffing ) and things only get better.
5012116~Highly recommended!
5012117~Serve with hot chocolate.
5014234~I've always loved coleslaws, using them as side dishes for everything from oyster rolls to whole grilled fish. Far from the chopped green cabbage with flecks of carrot from our school cafeteria days, the slaw can be quite elegant.
5012119~"Chef Jimmy Bradley's wonderfully simple combinations of texture and flavor at New York City's The Red Cat were the inspiration for this zucchini dish—it makes a great accompaniment to ""lazy lasagne."""
5012120~Highly recommended!
5012121~Highly recommended!
5012122~Raisins steeped in dark rum mingle with tart and sweet apples in this updated version of an American favorite. It's a showstopper when paired with lightly sweetened whipped cream.
5016076~A simply spectacular main-course. Ask the butcher to grind any pork trimmings to use in the stuffing. Either hard cider or Pinot Noir would be delicious alongside.
5012124~Highly recommended!
5012125~This terrific combination is very nice with baked ham.
5012126~The marmalade can also be served with a cheese plate or simply spread on toast.
5012127~A refined version of a New Orleans classic. Ask the butcher to remove the backbone and quarter the duck.
5012128~Highly recommended!
5012129~This satisfying stew just may be the essence of Cajun cooking: shrimp with onion, celery, and green pepper, all given depth by brown roux and livened up with cayenne.
5012130~Highly recommended!
5012131~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012132~If you don't have apple brandy, simply substitute apple cider. In addition to the crystallized ginger, the cinnamon sugar sprinkled on the crust adds a lovely essence. To serve this very special pie, I suggest topping each slice with a bit of cheddar cheese.
5012133~The manly art of grilling reached its first peak in this decade, as dads stood by their Webers, stoking the fire and pulling dinner from its clutches while moms did the shopping and cleanup. Besides burgers and wienies, people loved to make shish kebab. Today, grilling knows no gender, and skewers remain a handy way to prepare small foods. Experience has taught us that the vegetables are best cooked separately, or not at all—as this hot-cold, tender-crunchy wonder of a sandwich illustrates.

5012157~When buying fresh apricots, look for fruit that is plump, fragrant, and gives a little when squeezed. Poaching time depends on the ripeness of the fruit.
5012158~To cut baking time, fork the tuber a few times, then nuke for 5 minutes.
5012159~Make any kind of shape you'd like. The cookies can be rounds instead of rectangles, and you can use any smaller cutter for the cutouts.

5012161~Highly recommended!
5012162~Chef Hugo Bolanos of Los Angeles' Hotel Bel-Air shared this recipe exclusively with Epicurious. His turmeric-infused green juice features apples, celery, kale, and parsley but it's a flexible recipe, so feel free to experiment with different veggie combinations. Bolanos recommends swapping in Japanese cucumber for the celery, and substituting Swiss chard for the kale.
5012163~Lightly frying the zucchini for this dish is the only step that takes a bit of time. And the result is wonderful; the thin slices, accented with garlic, mint, and lemon, meld perfectly with the pasta.
5012164~Strawberries and rhubarb are just two of the many flavorful produce varieties grown in this region. During fall and winter, the frozen versions stand up surprisingly well, especially in dishes like this compote, which we serve over ice cream or frozen yogurt for dessert or plain breakfast.
5016058~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012166~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5012167~A little bit of bacon and a handful of raisins add a smoky sweetness that balances the slightly bitter flavor of the little cabbages.
5012168~Highly recommended!
5012169~This mix of jicama, cucumber, bell pepper, and carrot would also make a good side dish for scallops or shrimp. To keep the slaw crispy, add the dressing just before serving.
5012170~Highly recommended!
5012171~Like the Dried Pear Soufflé, this dessert relies on dried fruit rather than a lot of fat for richness. The glazed cherries add color; dried cherries may be substituted if you like. Any fresh fruit in season can be used to garnish the dessert.
5012172~Highly recommended!
5012173~This dough will yield enough to make four large flatbreads or eight smaller ones.

5012182~Highly recommended!
5012183~In French bistros, confit duck legs are traditionally served with a very simple, sharply dressed frisée salad. This version of the light meal gilds the lily by switching out frisée for peppery watercress and adding juicy navel oranges and nuggets of toasted walnuts.

5012188~Robert H. Cobb, owner of the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood, is said to have invented this salad in the 1930s as a late-night snack for himself. No wonder it has remained an American classic. With the crunch of the iceberg and onions, the soft richness of the avocado, the saltiness of the bacon, the sweetness of the tomato, and the bite of the blue cheese, this salad has it all! And it is beautiful to boot.
5012189~Highly recommended!
5015676~Highly recommended!
5012191~There's quite a bit of lore surrounding beer-can chicken, and for good reason. Just look at that burnished mahogany bird. The steam from the brew flavors the meat and keeps it moist. The can props the chicken up, so it roasts evenly—no scorching, no flipping, no stressing. And you get to drink some beer. We're believers.
5012192~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012193~This dessert hits both sweet and savory notes. Aged balsamic vinegar has a syruplike consistency, so a little drizzle goes a long way.
5012194~(PATE SUCREE)
5012195~An unusual combination of flavors — sweet, savory, and briny.
5012196~Great-tasting ingredients add up to a thoroughly satisfying meatless entrée that's perfect for a cool autumn evening.
5012197~Highly recommended!
5012198~"The ""cream"" flavor in this blueberry-muffin-inspired cookie comes from one of Tosi's favorite inventions—Milk Crumbs (a streusel made from dry milk powder). The key to the soft center and crunchy edges? Scooping the dough onto the baking sheets and letting the cookies rest in the fridge overnight. Timing note: You'll need to make the Milk Crumbs before you start preparing the cookie dough."

5012200~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012201~Just about every book we've ever seen on southwest cooking includes a recipe for one of the spicy cornbreads of the region. Once you've tasted one, you'll know why — they are really delicious. This version is more of a pudding than a bread because it is quite moist and cheesy in texture. It makes a wonderful side dish to replace potatoes or rice, or it is quite satisfying eaten as a light entrée or lunch with a salad of fresh young greens.

5012205~A simple recipe for an impressive main course. Serve the lamb with the Saffron Couscous and baby carrots. Pour a Cabernet Sauvignon.
5012206~Pasta, lush tomatoes, and a pool of ricotta lend this dish all the flavor of a lasagne—without the heaviness.
5019186~Kick is the right word to describe this golden cocktail, which underscores the shot of ginger liqueur with ginger syrup and lemon.
5012208~Prunes take on a velvety texture in this Port sauce. The resulting syrup is silky and sweet, with a tropical vanilla fragrance.
5012209~Highly recommended!
5012210~Throughout World War II, everyone who had even a little plot of land was encouraged to grow a vegetable garden. Back then, this comforting soup would most frequently be made from water and contain no chicken, which was a Sunday treat. For convenience, you can skip the first part of this recipe and use six cups of stock or canned broth and omit the chicken altogether. But if you want to make the stock from scratch, be sure to do so a day ahead.
5012211~Highly recommended!
5012212~"Once a favorite breakfast of the Chinese, this dish might more accurately be called a daikon scramble. But the Chinese words for carrot and daikon are almost the same, and ""cake"" refers to the way the rice flour binds the ingredients."
5012213~This recipe was created to accompany Broiled Salmon with Curried Eggplant Cutney .
5012214~Highly recommended!
5012215~Toasted crushed coriander seeds add great flavor and fragrance to the dressing. Green Anjou or Comice pears would also work well here, but the red Anjou's rich maroon skin looks beautiful next to the lettuce.

5012221~Here's a quiche recipe that goes wheat free without skimping on flavor. We call for broccoli and Cheddar cheese, but you can trade out the broccoli for asparagus tips or halved cherry tomatoes and the Cheddar for Gruyère, Swiss, or Comté.
5012222~This classic stuffing doesn't taste fishy at all — the chopped oysters simply lend some depth and moisture.
5012223~Highly recommended!
5012224~"Arabs brought the eggplant to Sicily in the late tenth century and, in fact, the Italians once called eggplant radice arabica, or Arab root. It is an integral ingredient in Sicilian cuisine, and the variety of recipes featuring it — the most famous being caponata — is astounding. Sicilians often serve room-temperature vegetable preparations as appetizers. In this one, a caper-flavored tomato sauce ""blankets"" the eggplant."
5012225~If you don't happen to have eight ramekins, you can assemble the sauce and eggs in a single baking dish and increase the baking time if needed.

5012235~The beans need to soak overnight.

5012237~For stress-free, no-sweat hosting, grill the lamb a few hours ahead of time and slice it at room temperature.
5012238~Across Southeast Asia, roadside vendors with small hibachis grill up delicious skewers and other street snacks. Inspired those fresh, tasty treats, this appetizer features grilled shrimp served with two simple yet boldly flavored dipping sauces.

5012246~The type of fish you use is less important than its quality. Black bass, striped bass, and fluke all translate well; ask your fish guy for what's freshest.
5012247~If one large fish is difficult to find, two smaller ones can be substituted.

5012253~My grandmother passed this recipe down to my mom and she then passed it on to me. It's a casserole of pure comfort. First, bitter endive is simmered until sweet, then wrapped in savory ham and smothered with a creamy nutmeg béchamel. Gruyère tops it off before it's baked until bubbly and golden.
5012254~Highly recommended!
5012255~A simple lemon and oil dressing-which works with just about any fresh vegetable-turns some of your garden's finest into a light summer pasta salad. Serve it in lettuce cups for a nice presentation.
5012256~Here's a centerpiece dish that really lives up to the name. Uncork a Cabernet Sauvignon, red Bordeaux or red Super-Tuscan.
5012257~(Pasta con Ragù di Vitello, Salsicce e Porcini)
5012258~The chef's salad is a familiar yet fading star in the salad world. In delicatessens, diners, and airport snack bars everywhere, we find its faithful components: lifeless leaves of iceberg lettuce, suspiciously blue-hued slices of hard-boiled egg, wedges of pallid tomato, and rubbery chunks of cheese, ham, and turkey. To top it all off (or perhaps sitting alongside): gloppy, high-calorie dressing.
5012259~Vegetables from the supermarket salad bar get an Asian spin. Start with purchased wonton soup, and serve a mixed green salad with ginger vinaigrette alongside the rice. Sliced pineapple with coconut sorbet is the perfect finish. Look for hoisin at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of most supermarkets.

Neil also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page. For your convenience, we've converted the measures — with as much accuracy as possible — from Australian to American. For those who have metric equipment and wish to follow Neil's recipe to the milliliter, we've included the original measures too.
5015046~Editor's Note: This recipe goes with Daniel Humm and Will Guidara's Manhattan Clam Chowder .
5012265~This is a great one for midweek as it takes no more than 20 minutes from slicing the leeks to serving the finished dish, but it is good enough for weekends as well-filling, fresh and very tasty.
5012266~Nice accompaniments for this Sicilian-style shrimp dish are sautéed broccoli and some orzo (rice-shaped pasta; also called riso) with butter and lots of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. For dessert, serve sliced pears and almond cookies.
5012267~Highly recommended!
5012268~Marinate the chicken overnight, then pop it into the oven the next day.
5012269~Highly recommended!
5012270~Used as healing compounds since the early days of medicine, herbs have strong scents and flavors that indicate the presence of unique phytonutrients. Study after study shows that traditional healers were right: these plants are medicine. This simple dish brings some serious plant power with the fresh herbs, mushrooms, olives, and quinoa. Mushrooms also contain unique phytonutrients, helping you round out this meal. For your next brunch, serve up some healing!
5012271~Here, something savory becomes addictively sweet and salty. The confectioners sugar helps brown the eggplant, and panko adds crunch.
5012272~"There are only five employees at The Little Rooster Cafe, a small breakfast and lunch spot, but its terrific food and friendly service make it popular with locals and tourists (especially those who come to browse the town's outlet stores). Chef and co-owner Hub Poelmann features a different waffle every day. ""We have an open kitchen,"" he says. ""People smell the waffles cooking, and then order them."" Poelmann credits his cooks with this lemon-poppy seed recipe, which was the happy result of ""playing around in the kitchen."""
5012273~The butter is also delicious over scallops. Serve the dish with steamed rice.
5012274~Few can resist this soup-stew of tender cannellini beans, silken pork shoulder, tomatoes, and herbs. We give the cherry tomatoes a little extra love in the oven to boost their flavor before we stir them into the beans. Rosemary is a natural in this dish, but its the generous amount of parsley added at the end thats the real revelation. The herb adds a zesty top note to the beans. Simple side dishes—garlic bread, a green salad—complete the picture.
5012275~Homemade malted vanilla-bean ice cream is layered with a bittersweet chocolate sauce and drunken dried cherries.
5012276~Pastry chef Valerie Hill offers this appealing treat at the Morrison-Clark Historic Inn & Restaurant in Washington, D.C. Allowing the yogurt to drain produces the thick and creamy yogurt cheese.

5012284~Preserved lemon, an essential ingredient in Moroccan cooking, is made by pickling lemons in salt, lemon juice, and olive oil. Here, preserving just the peel (begin at least a day ahead) is an easy way to add an exciting note to the crème fraäche.
5019890~This recipe makes more ice cream than you'll need to fill the cones (see Coconut Tuile Cones with Passion-Fruit Ice Cream recipe), but it's so delicious you'll have no trouble getting rid of the leftovers.
5012286~Baking the potatoes for this recipe is a completely hands-off cooking process that also reduces some of the water content in the spuds, resulting in the easiest and most flavorful mash of all time.
5012287~"""What really makes this Korean- inspired dish delightful is the contrast between the crisp vegetables and the soft, chewy sweet potato noodles,"" says Mai Pham. Look for the noodles at Asian markets; cellophane noodles (sold in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets) also work here. For best results, choose a thicker noodle, about the size of spaghettini. Serve this dish at room temperature as a side or main."

5012323~Adobo means spice rub or marinade, and this particular recipe was introduced by African slaves and brought to Bahía in Brazil in the 17th century. I think that it gives tuna a new and exciting dimension. There is spiciness in the dish, as would be expected from an adobo. To provide the American palate a little relief from the heat, the tuna is served on a bed of lightly pickled cucumbers.
5012324~Try this with white beans on toast, in salads, or puréed and spread on pita.
5012325~A natural with pork, the compote is also a sweet topping for ice cream.
5012326~Spreading a little mayonnaise over the outside of the bread before grilling adds golden color and delicious crunch.
5012327~It's good news for America that grass-fed beef is increasingly available in supermarkets. Cattle were meant to eat grass, and they are efficient at converting that green goodness into nutrient-dense meat, rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamins A and E, to say nothing of environmental benefits. Because grass-fed beef is leaner than grain-fed, it's not quite as tender. So turning it into a meatloaf is a greatand economicalway to make a meal of it.
5012328~Serve this dish with French bread to get all the delicious sauce.
5012329~Tomatillos are usually the star of salsa verde, but pureed zucchini makes a surprisingly convincing stand-in.
5012330~Silky smooth and with a crunchy topping, this seductive soup packs a range of flavors — earthy, smoky, and tart-sweet. If you decide to omit the bacon, substitute 1 tablespoon butter when you cook your vegetables.
5012331~Serve this dish with brown rice.
5012332~This dessert can be transformed to fit occasions other than Valentine's Day. Try experimenting with round, square, or triangular meringue shapes. And even though you'll only need 4 meringue layers, the recipe calls for 6—thus allowing for the possibility of breakage…or snacks!
5012333~Traditionally, Indian cooking calls for ghee, a kind of clarified butter for which the milk solids are browned. Here's a simpler approach: Use straight clarified butter; the milk solids are removed so the butter doesn't burn as easily. This can be made at least a week ahead.
5012334~Highly recommended!
5012335~Highly recommended!
5012336~You'll be shocked at how light yet satisfying this pasta is—it's finished in a fast garlicky almond sauce, studded with peas, and topped with chopped roasted almonds.
5012337~It might seem odd to describe something cold—ice cream—as sultry, but there is no denying genuine come-hither appeal. Based on a traditional candy from Brittany (and a favorite flavor pairing among French and American chefs), the combination of salty and sweet exerts an almost primordial pull, and cream, milk, and eggs provide lush, luxurious texture.

5012350~Portobello and button mushrooms, along with herbs and garlic, enhance a creamy dish-which has no cream.
5012351~Think macaroni and cheese — only ten times better. This sophisticated version combines the nuttiness of Gruyère with the intense flavor of parmesan, juicy poached chicken, and a crisp, cheesy crust. If you're short on time, feel free to use cooked rotisserie chickens (see cooks' note, below). In that case, though, don't add salt to the sauce, as the stock made from the rotisserie chickens will already be salty.
5012352~Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

5012386~Chef Lisa Ahier likes the flavor of Key limes or Mexican limes, which she can buy locally and year-round, for the marinade below. But even if you use regular lime juice, you'll love this chicken, which is as delicious at room temperature as it is hot. In fact, Gourmet's food editors couldn't get enough of it.

I don't know if it's the addition of mustard that brings frowns to the faces of North Carolina barbecue purists or the fact that this is a South Carolina sauce, but this sauce certainly illustrates the diverging tastes and traditions of barbecue in the Carolinas.

5012408~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012409~This is one of my favorite burgers. The charred onions develop a deep sweetness that perfectly counterbalances the earthy, slightly sour character of the rye bread and the nutty flavor of the Swiss cheese. This is a first-class knife-and-fork burger that you will want to eat again and again.
5012410~The mixture known as duxelles (diced mushrooms cooked with shallots or onions) probably dates back to the seventeenth century. It is said that the famous chef La Varenne, who worked for the Marquis d'Uxelles, created this recipe to preserve mushrooms. Serve this tart with baby greens for a light lunch, or enjoy it as a starter with a white Burgundy.
5012411~The compote here is a reminder that the tomato is a fruit, and its natural sweetness plays up that of peach. The combination is great with juicy curry-rubbed pork.
5012412~Also great topped with butter and jam.
5016006~As in the case with most famous dishes, there are more ways than one to arrive at a good boeuf bourguignon. Carefully done, and perfectly flavored, it is certainly one of the most delicious beef dishes concocted by man, and can well be the main course for a buffet dinner. Fortunately you can prepare it completely ahead, even a day in advance, and it gains in flavor when reheated.

5012426~Not everything Feniger serves at her restaurant is typical street food, and here's a delicious case in point. The intriguing combination of shredded brisket, diced root vegetables, and apples is based on a recipe that Feniger's grandmother Sylvia Morgan often made for family meals in Toledo, Ohio. Roasted poblano chiles, a nod to the chefs days at Santa Monica's Border Grill, add a spark of heat, and a fried egg makes it enormously satisfying.

The recipe makes enough to marinate about 1 1/2 pounds of seafood or poultry. Any marinade coming in contact with raw meat, seafood or poultry must be boiled for one minute before using it for basting.

Our mint chip ice cream is a creamy white speckled with chocolate chips and is one of our best sellers. It's incredibly easy to make and is most certainly a crowd-pleaser. We recommend showing some restraint with the mint extract—after all, you can always add more—lest your ice cream wind up tasting like toothpaste.

5015022~Corn bread sweetened with sugar must be a Yankee invention, because corn bread in the South is always a savory staple. We like to keep it simple, but don't stint on the fat, whether butter or bacon fat (or oil, if you must). Corn bread, corn muffins, and corn sticks should all be cooked to a dark shade of golden brown and turned out while hot, the steam rising fragrant with the aromas of corn and bacon, as you break into them.

If the sun-dried tomatoes feel brittle, refresh them by placing them in a nonreactive bowl, add 1 cup boiling water, and let them set until plump. The parsley and basil are interchangeable, so feel free to double up based on availability and preferences.

5012492~Brussels sprouts aren't the first ingredient anybody thinks of when they think of Italian food, but this salad takes a basic equation from the Italian kitchen—fresh vegetables, olive oil, and a little bit of Italian cheese—and makes the sprouts work in the context of the cuisine. It's also a healthier, fresher salad for the winter months.

5012495~Farofa is the term for a side dish using toasted farinha de mandioca—in English, manioc flour, which is a dried flour similar in looks and texture to breadcrumbs, made from yucca. The making of farofa as a dish couldn't be easier. It is plain manioc flour toasted in butter. A few of the classic farofa dishes include eggs and scallions, eggs and bacon, banana, bell peppers, and dendê oil, green beans and carrots, peas and corn, and so on and so forth. Farofa can be extremely dry, since the manioc flour immediately sucks up all the juices from anything it encounters, especially when it's served plain. The trick to making a moist farofa is to use a small amount of manioc flour in proportion to the other components, turning a side dish into a savory accompaniment that is so tempting, you may even forget there is a main course.
5012496~Spoon this over rice noodles or linguine, and have a crisp coleslaw of bean sprouts, shredded cabbage and slivered red bell pepper alongside. To finish, drizzle white rum over fresh pineapple and banana chunks.
5015741~Colombia may be the best kept barbecue secret in South America. Sure, Argentina gets the attention for its cowboy-style asado. And Brazil has enjoyed spectacular success exporting its rodizio-style restaurants—the kind where the waiters parade spits of grilled meats through the dining room. But Colombia? I doubt that most North Americans could name a single Colombian grilled dish. Well, it's time to shine the spotlight on the only country in South America to have coasts on both the Atlantic and the Pacific, whose cool-weather ranching district produces well-marbled, full-flavored beef, whose grill masters make extensive use of marinades (unlike the simplicity prized by their Argentine counterparts), and whose mastery of the art of grilling on charcoal extends to some unique techniques. Here's a not-so simple flank steak redolent of cumin, green onions, and beer.
5012498~This poultry dish features many of the flavors of the classic Moroccan dish b'stilla but is much easier to make.
5012499~For best results, use fresh ricotta, which is sold at Italian delis and specialty cheese shops. Avoid packaged brands that include gelatin and preservatives, as these can be watery and have a grainy texture. Prepared cannoli shells are sold at Italian markets.
5018376~This version of the classic is gorgeously cheesy, not gunky. Slow cooking gives the broth depth of flavor and a silky texture.
5012501~What to drink: Roberto Santibañez recommends a Petite Sirah (a full-bodied, peppery red wine varietal) from L.A. Cetto in Mexico's Guadelupe Valley. Or try the Guenoc Petite Sirah from California's North Coast.

5012504~"Baklava (from the Farsi for ""many leaves""), a pastry perfected by royal bakers in the sultan's palace in Istanbul, consists of layers of phyllo filled with nuts and spices and drenched in a syrup. It has become a traditional Middle Eastern Rosh Hashannah and Purim treat but is enjoyed at celebrations throughout the year. There are numerous variations of baklava, many a closely guarded secret passed down within families. A walnut filling is more prevalent in the Levant, while pistachios and pistachio-almond fillings are preferred in Iran. Blanched almonds are traditional on Rosh Hashannah to produce a light color so that the year should be dulce y aclarada (""sweet and bright""). Sephardim refrain from serving dark-colored pastries such as those made from walnuts on Rosh Hashannah, which would portend a dark year. Although purists disdain anything except the classic nut filling, some cooks innovated by adding such items as dates and chocolate chips. Hungarians make an apricot version. This very rich treat is usually served in small portions."

5012511~Olive oil in a dessert might seem a little odd, but try to think of it as a flavorful ingredient rather than a fat...as long as you choose a delicious extra-virgin oil. I first had something like this in Jabugo, Spain, when I ate slices of orange simply drizzled with a grassy local oil as a dessert. It was a revelation. If you want to go dairy-free in this dessert, then skip the yogurt and mix the mint in with the grapes.
5012512~This deep savory dressing makes simply cooked vegetables come to life.

5012514~Kaffir lime leaves give this spiced nut mix its citrusy, floral notes. Can't find any? Just double the lime zest.

5012516~Cracklings made from the leftover duck skin top this satisfying pasta dish.
5012517~Try this with your next roast beef or pork sandwich, on either pumpernickel or rye.
5012518~The peppers can be roasted and the broccoli blanched a day ahead, leaving just the sautéing to do before serving. This dish is equally delicious served right off the stove or at room temperature.
5012519~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.

5019221~Pillsbury test kitchen home economists have heard it all. When they told me some people were adding melted ice cream to a cake mix, I couldn't believe it. Well, that's precisely what I did with this fun recipe. Choose your flavor and let the ice cream melt. The only trick is that you must have 2 cups of melted ice cream. For super-premium ice creams with little overrun, that's 1 pint frozen. But for less expensive brands with a lot of air piped in, you'll need to begin with more than a pint.

5012534~In Texas, barbecue is about beef: specifically brisket, the cut by which any joint is judged. Brisket has become a favorite of restaurant chefs, too, hence the smoke ribbons and Hank Williams songs drifting out of restaurants as far away as Brooklyn. But can great brisket be made at home? I devoted a weekend to the task and learned that with a few key ingredients— salt, pepper, patience, and advice from Aaron Franklin, my neighbor and the pitmaster at Franklin Barbecue in Austin—swoonworthy results are doable. You just have to take the time—12 smoky hours.
5012535~Kangkong Masak Lemak
5012536~This tangy dressing really livens up a plate of crisp salad greens. It's also great on a baked potato or as a dip.
5012537~Meatless doesn't mean dainty. When making a veggie-centric sandwich, load up on aggressive flavors and contrasting textures, and be sure to add something substantial to sink your teeth into, like roasted vegetables, sliced hardboiled eggs, or mashed beans. This vegetarian powerhouse from Brooklyn's Saltie balances salty feta and olives with a salad-like mix of fresh herbs. Plenty of pickled, vinegary ingredients (this one uses capers and pickled beets, but any pickled veg would work) keep the full-flavored components bright.
5019959~Making moussaka is something of an undertaking—a rich meat sauce (made here with lamb, but you can substitute other ground meats such as turkey, veal, or even pork, if you prefer), layered with tender eggplant and a cheese sauce. You can make the moussaka in two smaller casserole dishes to serve one now and freeze one to bake later.
5012539~Getting the consistency of the creamy mushroom sauce right is key for this pasta recipe. You want to reduce it just until it clings to the pasta to create a light coating; be careful not to reduce it too much.
5012540~At Restaurant Biga in San Antonio, owner-chef Bruce Auden's co-chef, Mark Bliss, created this lovely side dish. He pairs it with roast pork, chicken or lamb. Cipolline onions are small, sweet Mediterranean onions; they are available at some supermarkets.

5012561~"Don't let the unappetizing-sounding name fool you: I'm talking about mold as in ""shape"" here. I'm from New Orleans, which means I grew up with a lot of socializing, most of it centered around food. There, both the front door and the refrigerator door are always open for friends or family who drop in. My mother always seems to have a steady stream of visitors, whether it's a neighbor who's stopped by for tea, one of her many siblings who happen by at dinnertime, or me with a whole troop of friends in for Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest. True New Orleanian that she is, she always has something good to eat. This seafood mold is a common dish at parties all around the city, and as improvisation is the hallmark of New Orleans cooking, each chef has her own version. I haven't gotten to the stage where I've made my own mark on this recipe yet, so I just copy Mom's."
5012562~The coffee marinade is sweetened slightly with a little maple syrup, and the sauce gets a kick thanks to a jalapeño chile.
5013248~"To keep things simple, we don't peel the fruit before baking it. As a result, it's best to avoid ''fuzzy"" fruits such as peaches and apricots."

5012567~"The Cornish pasty, a meat-filled hand pie (rhymes with ""nasty,"" not ""hasty""), was brought to northern Michigan by English immigrants, who ate it for lunch as they worked in the mines. For good reason—it's portable, fortifying food with straightforward flavor. A pasty-eating tradition remains in the region; they're nowadays typically served with butter and ketchup."

5017862~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012570~Chocolaty almonds are better than a gift certificate for a facial. Vitamin E in the nuts gives skin a healthy glow, and chocolate— well, do we really need to sell you on that?
5012571~Highly recommended!
5017257~"Aromatic spice and herb blends can quickly turn an ordinary soup recipe into something extraordinary. Here they transform a basic carrot soup into a special concoction you'll crave again and again. So start utilizing the ""cook once, eat twice"" theory; just freeze half of the recipe or make a double batch whenever possible."
5012573~Offer this meatless main-course salad with a basket of seeded flatbreads, steamed artichokes, and a lemon-mayo dipping sauce. Follow the meal with a bowl of apricots and some purchased baklava.
5012574~Highly recommended!
5012575~A mild or fruity olive oil works best in this cardamom-scented cake. Just try not to eat all of the candied orange slices before the cake cools.
5012576~The Caipirinha is Brazil's most popular cocktail. The drink is traditionally made with limes, but Amber uses tangerines instead.
5012577~An unexpected side dish that can be made hours ahead of a party; wait until the last minute to toss together.
5012578~Roasted potatoes are good and all, but a roasted root vegetable medley is just as easy to make and a little bit fancy too. Substitute any root vegetable, including starchy potatoes, turnip, parsnip, celery root, or rutabaga. While the veggies are roasting, toss a garlic bulb or two into the pan at about the 30-minute mark—the result: easy, creamy garlic! Yum.
5012579~The deep flavors in this lush and hearty dish are too good for anyone to pass up. Vegetarians can substitute water for the chicken broth and still enjoy the succulent, melt-in-your-mouth eggplant.
5012580~Here's a very simple salad that's loaded with Southeast Asian flavor.

5012582~Use this for the Springtime Sushi Nests or for any sushi recipe.
5012583~For an especially quick and easy meal, buy prepared Chinese barbecued pork loin (3/4 pound will be plenty). This pink-tinged meat is available at many Asian supermarkets—or you may even be able to purchase it from your neighborhood Chinese restaurant.
5012584~Serve this zesty dip with crackers or cut-up raw vegetables.
5012585~This homey sauce complements the savory tastes of the turkey and stuffing.
5012586~Coconut milk is a staple in Thai cooking, but you don't have to limit it to Asian food; it's a great resource for making anything super yummy and creamy. I like Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. To give this velvet soup a tiny bit of crunch and extra visual appeal, chia seeds are stirred in after the soup is pureed.
5012587~This dish combines Spanish escabeche (marinated poached fish) with a new take on mojo, a Cuban sauce typically made with the juice of tart oranges, garlic, and herbs.

5012598~Just two additions—citrus zest in the dressing and toasted pine nuts—transform this simple salad into something memorable.

5012600~This tart is a tradition-forming mix of caramel, crunchy pecans, and melted chocolate. Be sure to let it rest for 30 minutes before serving.
5012601~The sunny yellow color of egg bread adds a visual warmth to classic bread stuffing. This stuffing, interspersed with nubbins of sage-laced breakfast sausage and studded with tart cherries and toasted pecans, is so memorable, we guarantee it will be talked about wistfully long after the turkey carcass has turned into soup.
5012602~There's a layer of chocolate between the cookie-like crust and the rich filling of this sophisticated spin on the traditional pecan pie.
5012603~What to drink: Abarbanel 2001 Syrah, Vin de Pays de l'Aude, France (kosher) or Clos du Bois 1999 Reserve Shiraz, Alexander Valley.

5012606~Here's a quick way to feed a crowd. The salmon is also great made ahead and served chilled.
5017518~It's best to shuck your own clams, but if you buy them on the half shell, be sure to ask for the clam liquor.
5012608~Shrimp or sea scallops would also work well in this recipe. Serve with: Grilled plum tomatoes, herbed orzo salad, and grilled French bread.

5012613~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012614~For this recipe, the greens taste best if sautéed just before serving, but you can cook the bacon and stems ahead; leave the pan on an unlit burner 'til go time.

5016263~I first created this recipe at Routh Street Cafe in 1984. I've since had it on menus at five different restaurants in some form or another. It's also delicious when spread with a mixture of one part jalapeño jelly and three parts cream cheese whipped together. It's also best served warm.

5015881~If you're short on time, you can substitute bottled red curry paste (we recommend Mae Ploy brand) for homemade, but the flavor will not be as nuanced. There will be some curry paste left over after making the jungle curry and steamed catfish. Simply stir the remainder together with unsweetened coconut milk to give chicken, shrimp, or mussels a Thai spin.
5013376~In every good restaurant kitchen, there's a combination of thrift and innovation. We always have a dish like this chowder on the menu because when we portion fish for main courses, there are inevitably some pieces of our excellent, sushi-quality fish too small to serve on their own. And that is another great reason to buy your fish whole: not only can you save the bones and head for fish stock, but you'll be generating two meals from one shopping trip.
5012625~(Toasted Almond, Cinnamon and Chocolate Torte)

5012644~The quantity of meat you'll have in your finished stock will vary depending on whether you use shanks or hocks. Although shanks from the butcher yield more meat, they are not as widely available as hocks, which can be found at most supermarkets.

5018998~Bacon and a little cream give this chowder lashings of decadence — but, because there are no thickeners, it's surprisingly light.
5012651~In 1997, my Tra Vigne crew and I cooked for a week at the Mandarin-Oriental in Bangkok, Thailand. The hotel's chef wouldn't let me leave without giving him this recipe. It will look familiar to everyone, but wait until you taste it.
5012652~Processing your pickles in a hot-water bath rather than a boiling-water bath will give you a firmer texture. It follows that if you want pickles with real snap, don't process them at all. These dill-pickle spears—or sandwich chips, depending on how you slice them—can be processed, if you want, for long-term shelf storage, but first try making a batch to keep in the refrigerator. They will be crisp, and the flavor of raw cucumber comes through. It's the freshest-tasting pickle in this book, and perhaps my favorite. The recipe can be scaled up.
5012653~Guests will go wild for these little pies. They're at once delicate and decadent, the airy puffs of crisp meringue giving way to rich, vanilla-flavored pastry cream and a sprightly mix of fresh fruit.
5012654~If you use commercial pork in this recipe, you might want to rub the chops with the salt mixture and let them sit for a full day in the fridge. The long rest will make the meat extra-juicy. Bone-in heirloom rib chops have ample marbling, so the meat will be naturally moist. They dont need to rest as long with the salt rub—an hour or two should be sufficient. These are some big chops, so you might be able to share.
5012655~"""When I was a small child, my father used to take my elder brother and me to New York City for St. Patrick's Day,"" writes Stephanie Foley of Massapequa, Long Island. ""We would spend the morning marching in the parade while my mother, back in Long Island, prepared a feast of corned beef, cabbage, and potatoes. But what we all truly looked forward to was her Irish soda bread. It's savory and substantial — and unlike any other I have tried. I hope you all enjoy it as much as we do."""
5012656~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012657~Egg whites replace the usual oil or butter.
5012658~There is no better use for leftover rice than chahan. A brief trip in a pan resurrects the grains and a few pantry ingredients—little more than eggs, oil, and salt—transform tired rice into a super-satisfying meal. To give the humble dish a little flair, I whip up a saucy broth filled with vegetables and shrimp and pour it on at the last minute. Of course, you can add any ingredients you like—peas or asparagus, kimchi or Japanese pickles, pork, or even, as I do at Morimoto Napa, duck confit.
5018096~Homey and old-fashioned, this comforting dish can be on the table in a flash, thanks to store-bought rotisserie chicken and biscuits made with self-rising flour.
5018889~We love the rich, salty flavor of anchovies, especially with lamb, but we don't really want to bite into one. Chop until they're practically a paste.
5014906~Highly recommended!
5012662~"I love how the fruitiness of Cluizel Concepción chocolate, mellowed by a little cream cheese, plays against the caramel and the flowery, slightly musky acidity of the blossoms (actually, calyces) called ""Jamaica flowers"" in Mexico and red hibiscus in this country. (They are what gives Red Zinger tea its color.) When I first developed this recipe, I used hibiscus to flavor the caramel, but now I include it in a separate sauce where its red color makes a gorgeous contrast with the dark flan."
5012663~I make this for a holiday dinner or when I'm planning to have a large group of friend and family over. The outside of the turkey is encrusted with a baked-on pepper rub. Inside, the meat is juicy and tender.
5012664~The beauty of oven omelets and frittatas is that they need no crust (unlike a quiche). Fortunately, the slow cooker does this job well—the eggs stay moist and tender thanks to the steady, low temperature. Be ready to serve and eat the frittata as soon as it is done cooking; for the best texture and flavor, do not let it stand on keep warm. The frittata needs maximum surface area to cook, so it works best in a large oval slow cooker. Serve with fried potatoes, or fruit salad and ciabatta toast.
5012665~People often think of turnip soup as bitter and thin, but this one, made with young delicate turnips, is creamy and sweet. Blanching the turnips first removes any bitterness, and the sharpness of the greens makes a delicious counterpoint to the sweetness of the turnips.
5014565~This is a perfect autumn salad: not so much cooked as wilted greens in a warm, savory-sweet vinaigrette. Here in the South, we are lucky to have so many different greens that grow remarkably well virtually all year round. From the traditional collards, spinach, mustard, and turnip greens to the international varieties that have recently made their way here, including bok choy, tatsoi, and komatsuna, there are a variety of tastes and textures to choose from. No matter where you live, experiment with seasonal greens until you find your favorites. If you're shopping at the farmers' market, most of the vendors will be happy to let you have a few nibbles for taste-testing. The same goes for the squash—you can use butternut, acorn, pumpkin, African, or any similar variety. At Summerland Farm, we are lucky to have American chestnut trees planted by my ancestors, and even luckier that those trees survived the chestnut blight that killed most American chestnuts in the first half of the twentieth century. Fresh chestnuts—often grown in California—are available in many natural foods stores in the cooler months. If you can't find chestnuts, hazelnuts or cashews would make a good substitute.

5012670~New potatoes are freshly dug and have tender skins; wash them gently so that they don't tear. If they're hard to find, any small potato or fingerling variety will work.
5012671~Highly recommended!
5012672~Few foods metamorphose as dramatically or alluringly as garlic when it is roasted. Hardly a savory recipe exists in which one could not imagine this substance. I always have these garlic preparations on hand.
5012673~Wonderfully festive and fun, these candied star-shaped chips — a favorite among children — have a slight tropical flavor that makes them a sunny treat with or without the strudel.
5012674~A hint of lemon is perfect in a creamy baked custard. This one has no caramel to get in the way of the lemon flavor. Lemon juice would be too overpowering here. Instead, the subtle lemon flavor comes from steeping lemon zest in the milk for the custard mixture. The heat of the milk extracts the essential oil from the lemon zest skin, and the milk absorbs the delicate flavor. The hints of cinnamon and vanilla are there to support the lemon, not obscure it. Raspberry sauce makes a perfect complement. I wouldn't dream of serving the custard without it.
5012675~These biscotti are equally delicious made with roasted almonds, pecans, or hazelnuts in place of the cashews.
5012676~Pâte de Fromage de Chèvre aux Herbes Fraîches
5012677~The flavorful olive salad is also nice with sea bass, red snapper or tuna. Serve with steamed new potatoes, and uncork a Sauvignon Blanc to go with dinner.

5012679~This North African-inspired stew is good over couscous with a little lemon juice and chopped mint. Because it's made with beef tenderloin, it's ready in minutes instead of hours.
5012680~Duck, turkey or dark chicken meat can substitute for the goose with equally delicious results. Fine accompaniments are a green salad with Roquefort vinaigrette and hot crusty bread. For a quick and sophisticated dessert, add a bit of red wine and ground cinnamon to canned pears with their syrup.

5012691~Good, cheesy pizza generally doesn't need much help in the flavor department, but a grilled pie has a smoky dimension (here amplified by meaty grilled eggplant) that always leaves people clamoring for more.
5012692~Highly recommended!
5012693~Mole, a classic Mexican chili sauce, gets streamlined here. Chipotle chilies (available canned at Latin American markets and many supermarkets) add heat, while unsweetened chocolate provides subtle sweetness. Serve the stew in shallow bowls with steamed rice. Add an arugula, orange, and red onion salad and a basket of warm corn tortillas. For dessert, offer cinnamon-spiked hot chocolate and wafer cookies.

5012697~With its slight bitterness, broccoli rabe takes well to assertive flavors. The classic Italian recipe calls for sautéing it with plenty of garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. But for Thanksgiving we've opted for something mellower, choosing sweet raisins, pine nuts, and a bit of sherry.

5012708~This is an insanely easy cake to make. It goes together in just minutes and tastes awesome: a touch ducky—more so if you use wild duck fat—sweet, but not overly so, with a little hit of rosemary to even things out. I originally made this as a sort of stunt, but it's so good I've put it into the regular rotation.
5012709~Highly recommended!
5012710~Intense chocolate flavor accented with orange highlights this lovely layer cake.
5012711~Slightly sweet, fresh ricotta, which can be found in many Italian markets, makes this starter especially delicious. Regular ricotta also works well.
5012712~These cookies are rolled in confectioners' sugar while warm, which gives them a thin buttery frosting.
5012853~"In this modern take on shortcake, the biscuits are filled with lemon curd, a ""marmalade"" made of a mixture of cooked and fresh fruit, and a spoonful of whipped cream. Keep in mind that the lemon curd needs to chill overnight."

5012727~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012728~The pleasant, earthy bitterness of molasses balances a typically too-sweet pecan pie filling for this thin sheet pie. A creamy chocolate ganache and crunchy candied pecans add extra texture and richness to this updated, shareable version of the classic Thanksgiving dessert.
5012729~Reducing a mixture of coconut liquid, cream, and sugar on the stovetop creates a wonderfully creamy filling, almost like a dulce de leche. Handfuls of fresh shredded coconut give the tarts a tropical flavor, accented beautifully by the fruitiness of prickly pears.
5012730~An extra chile for this harissa recipe will play up the heat, and if you’re feeling confident, you can customize the mix of spices as well.
5012731~Highly recommended!
5012732~"Breakfast often comes later when you're on vacation, so we figure it's okay to indulge in this refreshing Mimosa alternative. It's important to use pure mango nectar here (though it may not be labeled ""pure""); nectar mixed with other fruit juices or high-fructose corn syrup makes the drink too sweet."
5012733~The fish steams directly atop the gently simmering vegetables in this flavorful and very easy dish. Serve with steamed rice tossed with lots of chopped fresh cilantro.
5012734~Only native Californians like two wine-making friends of mine in Salinas can regularly throw together a vegetable chili such as this utilizing their almost year-round abundance of fresh vegetables and herbs. For those of us with seasonal gardens, various substitutions often have to be made (canned tomatoes, dried herbs, and the like), but such is the availability almost everywhere today of certain fresh produce even in the coldest months that no imaginative cook should have much trouble concocting a very tasty vegetable and bean chili according to this basic recipe. One advantage, by the way, of using a 28-ounce can of tomatoes with their juices instead of the fresh is that most likely you won't have to add any water to keep the chili slightly soupy.

5012745~At the thought of Morocco, the mind tends to wander to the teeming heart of Marrakech; but the windswept coastal city of Essaouira, with its whitewashed buildings and heaping displays of glimmering fish (which you can have grilled on the spot), offers another sort of paradise. We can't supply Essaouira's particular perfume of sea and smoke, but the simplicity and clean flavors of this lemon-infused dish will take you there in spirit.

5012752~This recipe is an accompaniment for Grilled Clams on the Half Shell with Ginger Mignonnette .
5012753~Bavarian cream is as famous as its origin is mysterious. It might have been invented by French cooks at the court of the Wittelsbacher, the powerful dynasty that ruled Bavaria for more than seven centuries until the last Bavarian king abdicated in 1918. Or possibly, it was first made by Isabeau de Bavière, daughter of a Bavarian duke who married King Charles VI of France in 1385. Whichever version you prefer, one thing is clear: Bavarian cream is deeply entrenched in history and a royal treat in the true sense of the word.

5012755~Chunks of fresh cranberries and dark, milk, and white chocolate chips dress up oatmeal cookies for the holidays.

5012768~This dish is made with chicken thighs, which have more flavor than chicken breasts but you can substitute chicken breasts if you like. The meat needs to be raw for this dish so it can absorb more of the flavor as it cooks. Although the recipe calls for tequila, you can substitute beer, orange juice, or pineapple juice if you prefer. The liquid smoke is optional, but it does add a nice extra kick of smoky flavor. Serve this dish with rice, refried beans, and frozen margaritas or a frosty glass of beer.
5012769~Highly recommended!
5014592~We took the feta cheese out of this classic dish and stirred it into the rice that accompanies it, for a yummy variation. A cucumber salad is the perfect partner. Buy your favorite cookies for dessert.
5012771~The goat cheese and relish keep these burgers especially moist. For a nice variation, omit the goat cheese, and top the turkey burgers with sliced Havarti or Monterey Jack cheese during the last few minutes of cooking. Set out bowls of pickles and olives, and pour chilled Chardonnay throughout the meal.
5019497~An easy side dish for ham or chicken. The dressing can be made a day ahead.

5012775~A bit of soppressata and cheese stuffed ingeniously between each leaf gives these artichokes a heartiness worthy of a special course. (Eat them as you normally would, scraping the leaf with your teeth—but in this case you'll get a mouthful of flavor-packed filling, too.) Using a pressure cooker speeds up cooking time and also results in incredibly tender artichokes.

5017532~Here's a tasty crust for a number of pies. Like any butter crust, chill the dough well before rolling out, or it will be difficult to work.
5012784~To mimic a traditional risotto, this grain-free version first simmers sunflower seeds to soften them to a rice-like texture, then purées a portion of them to create a creamy sauce. You can easily follow the sunflower cooking method for a basic go-to grain-free risotto, then swap in whatever seasonal vegetables you'd like to top it with.
5012785~The salsa is also delicious made with diced ripe mangoes.

5018950~"Tonya Morrison of Lewis Center, Ohio, writes: ""My husband and I had a wonderful time on our vacation to Kiawah Island, South Carolina. One night we had dinner at Rosebank Farms Café in Bohicket Marina Village. The recipe for their roast pork tenderloin with apple and raisin chutney would make a delicious souvenir."""
5012807~The ingredients here evolved from the Miraglia family's favorite way to roast capon, but the simplicity of this dish will resonate with anyone looking for a beautiful and delicious all-American turkey.
5012808~"A prized Christmas sweet from Tuscany, panforte means ""strong bread"" — but it's more like an almost-flourless fruitcake."
5012809~For dessert, Grimes was inspired by something from Vienna, a little farther along the Danube: linzertorte. It's traditionally made with hazelnuts and raspberry jam, but this version, with its warmly spiced almond pastry and vivid apricot filling, spoke to Grimes of the highly polished coffeehouses in that part of the world. Cooking dried apricots with brandy and sugar allows you to control the sweetness quotient, and the result is all about the magically musky, tangy fruit.

5012811~This dish is wonderful no matter what egg pasta you use. And the Greek feta can be found at most supermarkets.
5017179~"""Compound butters are a terrific blank canvas,"" O'Connell says. ""You can mix in all sorts of flavors—anchovies, capers, any herb or spice."""
5012813~Rather than being cooked in salted water, the pasta is treated like risotto—simmered in stock and stirred until cooked and creamy—which gives it plenty of time to pick up meaty flavors.
5012814~The steaks need to marinate overnight.
5012815~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5012821~"Beef brisket is one of the hardest meats to cook correctly. In Texas, this dish is a benchmark for how good a cook or restaurant is, and everyone has an opinion about how to do it right. Good food takes time, and this recipe will help you through the pitfalls of cooking a brisket. Don't ever steam your beef; it dries the meat and makes it tough. Applying a dry rub is important with large cuts of meat. Our BBQ Beef Coffee Cure is a select mixture of seasonings paired with an earthy dark-roasted ground coffee that complements the brisket. The salt and sugars in the rub will cure the outer portion of the brisket, leaving a hearty flavor and the smoke, charred crust called ""bark."""

5012829~"What could possibly be better than a strawberry milkshake? A strawberry cheesecake milkshake! The cream cheese, which has a tang of its own that's enhanced by the lemon zest, helps make this milkshake as thick as, well, concrete (the very apt Missouri term for a milkshake).
If the idea of frozen strawberries hits you as totally counter to your locavore sensibilities, know that they are another secret to a milkshake thick enough to eat with a spoon, and if you grow your own or buy them at the farmers' market, we urge you to freeze them for this shake. You'll find the directions in the Cooks' Notes at the end of the recipe."
5012830~Bonus points for serving one huge stack and making your family get all Jenga on it for seconds.
5012831~A lightly dressed salad of baby greens would complement this entrée nicely; serve rum-drizzled grilled pound cake slices afterward.
5012832~This is the South Indian equivalent of cake: essential at every wedding, birthday, and holiday. Indians like to serve it warm and soupy. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.
5012833~This entrée from Chateau Lake Louise at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, would be perfect for a dinner party. The fish is especially good accompanied by broiled red onion slices and steamed asparagus. To make this even easier, have the salmon skinned and boned at the fish market.
5012834~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012835~I have such fond memories of helping my mom make lasagna as a kid. I was in charge of layering the noodles, sauce, ricotta and mozzarella. Today, my lasagna is a bit lighter than my mom's. Rather than making it as a large tray, I prefer to make them into rolls—which I load up with vegetables—for better portion control. And here I swap tomato sauce for a wonderfully savory Butternut squash sauce with shallots, garlic, and Parmesan cheese.

5012840~Evocative of cassoulet but so much easier, this bean soup manages to be both rugged and elegant. No part of the confit duck legs goes to waste: The bones add savor to the beans, the meat goes into the soup, and the crisped skin makes a delectable garnish. Flambéing the Armagnac before adding it to the pot takes the edge off the alcohol while leaving behind the deep flavor of the barrel.
5012841~Roasting cauliflower with spices brings out the very best in this vegetable—the golden, crispy florets are irresistible. Like broccoli, cauliflower contains compounds that may help fight damaging toxins.

5012849~The heat of poblano chiles can vary dramatically. Season to taste by adjusting the amount of crushed red pepper before adding the clams.
5012850~Using miso on the turkey is a great way to get wonderfully moist meat — always a challenge at Thanksgiving. The skin doesn't get as crisp as it would without, but we think the succulent results are well worth the trade-off. The miso won't give the turkey an Asian flavor, but it will add a rich meatiness to the gravy. Don't use a brined or kosher turkey for this recipe or the bird will be too salty (miso has a high sodium content).
5012851~Cha Ca Thang Long
5012852~This dressing can also be used as a refreshing condiment for spicy curries.
5012853~"In this modern take on shortcake, the biscuits are filled with lemon curd, a ""marmalade"" made of a mixture of cooked and fresh fruit, and a spoonful of whipped cream. Keep in mind that the lemon curd needs to chill overnight."
5012854~This one-pot meal—lobster, corn, and green beans—conjures summer in New England. The simple sesame mayonnaise is outstanding for dunking and slathering.
5012855~Offer either brown or white rice and Asian beer, like Tsingtao. The chicken is especially tender because of the egg white and cornstarch coating.
5012856~This drink was featured as a Cocktail of the Month.

5012858~The warm spices in this version are the very essence of the holiday.
5012859~Argentine Red Sauce
5012860~If you've ever woken up with a hangover, you know why egg sandwiches have earned their spot in the comfort-food canon. But the day-after staple can cure your dinnertime blues, too. The necessities: a runny yolk; soft, griddled bread; and something fresh to keep the fat attack in check. Once you've nailed these basics, it's about adding a few more elements for flair. This version, from Austin's Noble Sandwich Co., uses quick-pickled onions (proof that pickles make everything taste better), Sriracha mayonnaise to bring the heat (a dash of hot sauce would also do the trick), and arugula for brightness and bite. Throw some avocado on there, or sliced ripe tomato, if you're in the mood. The point is, think savory, think seasonal, and wake up to a new reality.
5012861~Healthy bonus: Magnesium and folate from spinach; fiber from apples and buns; antioxidants from rosemary and sage

5012863~Highly recommended!
5012864~The earliest Mexican cuisine was vegetable-based, so in times past, before Spanish beef, chicken, and pork worked their way into every taco, there were no doubt plenty of satisfying vegetable taco recipes. Today most vegetables are consumed as salsas, in soups, or stuffed into quesadillas and empanadas, but there's no reason why a vegetable taco shouldn't be every bit as tasty and unusual as any other. This sumptuous vegetarian feast is based on the classic combination of roasted poblano chiles and mushrooms, with the addition of corn and mild-flavored, soft queso fresco. This taco is often favored by even the most committed carnivores. In other seasons, bits of diced cooked sweet potato, zucchini, chayote, squash blossoms, or golden winter squash would be welcome additions.
5012865~Unlike most braises, these ribs aren't browned before they're simmered. The long, slow simmer tenderizes the meat, and the ribs get their brown, shiny exterior from a soy and brown sugar marinade. The ideal drink pairing? Ice-cold Thai beer.
5012866~An addictive slaw with sweetness from the fresh coconut and sneaky, creeping heat from the chiles. Be warned! This recipe is from Bad Saint, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.
5012867~Steep cucumber and mango in the wine for three hours or longer for maximum flavor. Once the fruit sinks, the wine is ready.
5012868~The mild flavor of leeks adds a nice touch to the pasta's tomato-based sauce.
5012869~You got your breast men and your leg men and your thigh men, but let me tell you something: I'm a wing man. What I love about wings is that you get a two-in-one treat when you eat them: Between the drumette and the flat, that's some good gnawing. Wings are great for weeknight cooking too, because they take very little time to prepare and cook.

5012875~Highly recommended!
5016043~We're skipping the classic cubes in favor of tangled butternut ribbons baked into a moist flat cake for a seriously showstopping first course. Pair the squash with a mix of spicy arugula and ever-so-slightly-bitter chicory enhanced with savory pancetta and toasted hazelnuts. A sweet-tart apple vinaigrette is the final touch atop the most refreshing fall salad we've tasted in a long time.

5012878~P> The secret to properly cooked Chinese-style rice, whether white or brown, is to first rinse the rice and then to avoid cooking it in too much water. For fried rice, the rice should be cooked until just tender to the bite.

5012880~"Called Jewish wontons or raviolis, kreplach are pasta dumplings, usually triangular in shape, filled with minced meat, onion-spiced potatoes, or cheese. Kreplach carries a lot of lofty symbolism; its triangular shape represents Judaism's three patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Equally lofty: the Jewish momma who can roll her kreplach dough to optimum thinness (so that, according to Sam Levenson, ""a tempting bit of their buried treasure should show through""). If the wrappers are not paper-thin, your kreplach will taste like ""craplach."" However, though we've included wrappers in this recipe, there's really no reason to knock yourself out making them. Just purchase wonton wrappers in a Chinese food store or supermarket, and making kreplach becomes a cinch. There's even a kosher brand called Nasoya, available in many supermarkets; look for it near the tofu."
5012881~No ice cream maker is needed to make this flavorful sorbet.
5012882~A leek, carrot, and celery mirepoix, cooked until tender with rich white beans, gets a crisp, crunchy texture and delightfully rustic flavor from a garlicky bread-crumb topping flecked with parsley.

5015618~We are always wowed by how complex in both flavor and texture hand-milled grits are compared to their supermarket counterpart, which we don't recommend for this particular recipe. Grits are best when freshly cooked, but if you're making an entire menu, you'll probably want to prepare them the day before (see cooks' note, below). We suggest storing raw grits in the refrigerator until you're ready to cook them.

5012903~Though many of us associate quesadillas with flour tortillas, in Mexico they're often made with uncooked corn tortillas that are folded in half around a filling like a turnover, then cooked on a griddle or fried. Here, we've enclosed delicate zucchini blossoms, tomatoes, onions, and Oaxacan string cheese.

5012914~The crunchy, salty, sesame-drenched celery sticks at Bar Goto in New York are so good, you’ll forget they’re made from vegetables.
5018547~There are hundreds, if not thousands, of barbecue chicken recipes out there, and we've certainly had our share, so we can say with authority that this spicy sweet-and-sour grilled chicken is the best we've had to date. It's got enough heat to titillate your taste buds, but not so much that kids will steer clear. The additions of tomato paste and soy sauce provide deep, dark, low notes that keep the sauce from squealing. In other words, it's heat with harmony.
5012916~Highly recommended!
5012917~The sweet-tart pan sauce is a perfect partner for a rich fish like salmon.

5012919~Like the classic combination of melon and prosciutto? Then you'll love this main-course pasta salad.
5012920~When shopping for ham, be aware that smoked pork shoulder is available partially or fully cooked. This will affect the braising time (partially cooked takes about 1 hour longer). We found that blanching the ham before braising helps eliminate excessive saltiness in both the ham and the broth. Leaving the skin on the ham adds body to the resulting sauce.
5012921~This gorgeous bird emerges from the oven nearly black and very deeply flavored. However, don't look for crisp skin; the mole keeps both the flesh and skin tender and moist.
5012922~Highly recommended!
5012923~Liptauer gained its name from the provenance of the fresh sheep's milk cheese with which it was originally made, Lipto, Hungary. Our version of this seasoned spread is made with cream cheese.
5012924~The carrots' natural sweetness plays off the tang of the mustard. This effortless dish pairs particularly well with the rosemary pork chop.
5012925~This combination of black and green olives, onion and garlic is a rendition of the relish served on the classic New Orleans sandwich called muffuletta from the Palladio restaurant in the Hyatt Regency in Rochester, New York.
5012926~These flavors and aromas transport me to Marrakesh, where our friend Latif, son of the late imam of the great mosque there, guided us through the bustling and mysterious spice markets. Here's how I've recaptured the memory: a boned leg of lamb is stuffed with intensely flavored dried apricots, high in beta-carotene and potassium, then rubbed with aromatic cumin. Buy your cumin from a Middle Eastern market or spice store for the most flavorful results.
5012927~Crushed pretzels make a better-than-breadcrumb crust.

5012929~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5012930~Typical Mexican enchiladas arrive rolled up and stuffed, but at my favorite enchilada street stand—the inspiration for this recipe—they're stacked in a messy, luxurious pile, with separate individual layers of corn tortillas, fresh cilantro and onion, green enchilada sauce, shredded cheese and chicken. The whole thing is topped with a blanket of crema and more cheese. It's almost like a deconstructed lasagna. The dish is enough to make you fall deeply in love with Mexico City—particularly when the corn tortillas are homemade, and the green sauce is prepared with a slow-simmering pot of fresh chicken stock.
5012931~These are especially good when made with leftover grilled turkey.
5012932~With steamed asparagus and some rice or mashed potatoes, this easy dish is elegant enough for company.
5012933~"Bartender Chris Hannah's creation is all about balance: He blends gin and herbaceous Chartreuse with maraschino liqueur, adding a splash of lime for brightness. We can't say if it's the ""last word"" on cocktails, as its name claims it to be, but you won't hear any complaints about it."
5012934~The acidity of the vinegar and grapefruit is balanced by the quince, apple, and pear flavors in this French-style chutney. Bananas add creaminess. Use ripe fruit for best results.
5012935~Many years ago, this delicious New York fountain drink was actually made with eggs, but it's been a long time since anyone's seen that version. If you are a serious egg cream lover, use a seltzer siphon to get the best foam.

5014471~Even if you're a fan of the traditional green bean casserole, you might want to consider subbing these simply prepared fresh beans, which can provide balance to all the rich items on the menu. Plus, this streamlined dish, which needs just a brief rewarming on top of the stove before serving, won't contribute to a last-minute traffic jam in the oven.
5012947~From India's restaurant in Denver, this side dish has whole peppercorns, cardamom and cloves. They are not meant to be eaten, so discard them when serving the rice.
5012948~Roasting brings out fennel's sweet side.
5012949~Smoked salmon and horseradish cream atop toast points with flutes of sparkling brut rosé make a sophisticated starter for this dinner. The meaty short ribs smothered with a succulent sauce team up perfectly with the Crispy Garlic Risotto Cakes and a simple sauté of red bell peppers and zucchini. Pour a robust Zinfandel to go with it all. Begin preparing this recipe a day ahead. Follow with a warm apple tart and ice cream for dessert.

5012952~This is my standard duck or goose stock. It is the stock that I call for in the recipes in this book. In other words, you need to make lots. Every time you get a carcass, save it for stock. If you dont have a lot of ducks around at one time, save them up for future rounds of stock making. You can chop up the carcasses before freezing, so they take up less space.

5012961~When the topic of chowder comes up, debates rage about the merits of the creamy New England style versus the red, tomato-packed Manhattan version. We'd be hard-pressed to choose a favorite, but one thing is for sure: We love chowder. It's comforting, hearty, and full of seafood. The same can be said of Thai-style seafood curry. Coconut milk stands in for cream, and curry paste packs a warming punch. Its global chowder— and it's delicious. That's something we can all agree on.
5012962~Serve with additional honey, if desired.
5012963~Mojo is a Cuban sauce made from the juice of sour oranges (or, in this case, a mix of orange juice and lime juice). It's truly versatile—the sauce works as a marinade or salsa for beef, fish, pork, and poultry—so no wonder it tastes great with hot dogs, too.
5012964~Tapioca, like semolina, is one of those things that a school kitchen could have turned you off for life. I couldn't eat it for years, having been force-fed it at primary school aged six, with tinned jam, as it oozed like frogspawn out of the bowl and I wept and retched. For years I had the same malicious feeling toward beets and mashed potatoes, which were instant and came in lumpy granules. My teacher and I had a silent war every lunchtime; a war that eventually came to an end after my parents removed me from the school. Made to your own wont, in your own kitchen, tapioca is ambrosial, and worth being a grown-up for, as is semolina. This could also be a pudding, not a breakfast, just don't serve it with dog foodlike tinned jam. Try a lovely homemade compote instead.
5012965~Veal in Switzerland often presupposes sauerkraut, but we prefer a lighter take. With crunchy radishes and bitter frisée, this salad brings its vinegar note in the form of a spicy mustard dressing.
5012966~More elegant than jam but just as handy, this compote goes with almost everything.
5012967~One of my favorite crops from my husband’s farm are his fall carrots. I prefer the fall carrots because as the weather gets colder the vegetable sugars concentrate, yielding the sweetest carrots of the year. We use lots of carrots in this recipe, so that it’s more about the carrots than anything else. For the best flavor, serve it cold the day after you make it. You can substitute chickpeas for the black-eyed peas, if you prefer to use another type of bean.
5012968~All hail kale: Research shows it turns on your body's natural detoxifying enzymes to help ward off lung and stomach cancers.
5017591~A lovely side dish with big flavors‑and only a single teaspoon of oil.

5018447~Using turkey meat rather than just bones adds a deep richness to this stock. Although you have to buy the extra parts, you'll be happy you did; great stock is the key to outstanding gravy, and everyone knows you can never have too much of that at Thanksgiving.
5012986~If you've got a can of tomatoes, a jar of spicy peperoncini, and a hunk of Parm in your fridge, you're halfway to a satisfying pasta dinner.
5012987~Poaching fish in olive oil — a popular restaurant technique — is surprisingly easy and well suited to every-night cooking.
5019748~We used what the turkey has to offer to create a base for the perfect gravy .

5012990~"Sue Ellison of Edgewater, Colorado, writes: ""Although I play guitar and piano, and have worked for more than 20 years as an elementary-school music teacher, at this point music is just my job; cooking is my passion. It's an interest I share with my daughter, Hannah. We do a phenomenal amount of cooking together. In fact, I think she learned how to count using chocolate chips, standing on a stool next to me at the kitchen counter while I baked chocolate croissants."""

5013004~"I believe the secret to my grandmother Grace's biscuits is that she would talk to them, saying, ""Rise, Mr. Biscuit, rise!"" And they would. Her buttermilk biscuits were quite similar to these, made with whole milk, but sometimes she'd substitute buttermilk and use baking soda instead of baking powder."
5013005~"Beware of packaging announcing a product is ""100 percent wheat"" — this designation can be used on foods made with refined wheat flour. To be sure of a product's nutritional value, read labels carefully: The first ingredient should be a whole-grain product. Check the fiber content — if the product doesn't contain a minimum of three grams per slice, you are probably dealing with an impostor."
5013006~Serve with ice-cold beer and your favorite slaw. Put out artisanal cheese and fresh fruit for dessert.
5013007~Skirt steak is an incredibly flavorful cut of meat that cooks in minutes. And since this recipe calls for just 3/4 cup wine, you'll have plenty left over to serve with dinner.

5013009~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5013010~"""Instead of staring at the ceiling one night when I was having trouble sleeping, I passed the time by baking,"" says Angelo Monaco of Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""The result of my insomnia was this chocolate cake. It's light, moist and really delicious."""
5013011~Romesco sauce, a piquant mixture of chilies, nuts, and tomatoes, is a typical seasoning for seafood in the Catalan province of Tarragona. Although fresh coriander is not an ingredient found in the traditional Spanish pantry, its flavor lends a nice touch to this dish.
5013012~For an easy and informal dinner, make a salad and some rice to go alongside this bubbling cheese mixture known as queso fundido. Each diner spoons some of the cheese into warm tortillas. This can also be served as an appetizer at parties. Mix up some Margaritas to add to the fun.
5017097~Highly recommended!
5013014~To make your own baharat spice blend, mix one teaspoon each of ground coriander and cumin with half a teaspoon each of cinnamon and paprika.
5013015~The magic of this easy dessert happens in the fridge as the lemon juice sets the cream into a luscious custard— no eggs or gelatin required.
5013016~A colorful one-dish meal with lots of flavor. If you like things spicy, use the larger amount of cayenne pepper.
5013017~Fresh orange juice always makes the best cranberry relish. Zest whole oranges before squeezing them for juice.
5013018~Here is our adaptation of aigo bouido, the restorative Provençal garlic soup. Simmering the garlic tames its bite. A green salad and crusty bread round out the meal.
5013019~This fresh chutney is an excellent condiment for beef, chicken, and fish.
5013020~Serve with: Orzo tossed with fresh oregano and green onions, and buttered carrots.
5013021~These addictive little fritters can be made in bite-size pieces perfect for cocktail parties, or slightly larger for plated appetizers. Their texture and flavor are reminiscent of hush puppies. Here the fritters are pan fried, but they can also be cooked in a deep-fryer at 375°F for about 3 minutes, turning them over halfway through cooking, until browned.

5013026~This is a breakfast that hits the mark for protein and taste, and it also happens to come with its own aromatherapy treatment. Mint calms and refreshes, so start your day by tearing up the mint leaves and taking a deep mindful breath. Pairing blueberries with greens gives you a powerful dose of plant-­based medicine, and covers your bases for your vitamin needs. The juicy wild blueberries plus an added subtle sweetness from the mint pair well with the vegetal taste of the greens.
5013027~Serve with steamed rice and some traditional condiments, such as chopped red and green onions, raisins, shredded coconut, peanuts and diced bananas.
5013028~Both turkey meat and gravy are used in this vibrant soup. Pass grated Parmesan cheese alongside if you like.
5013029~"""I have just returned from London, where I stayed at the beautiful Lanesborough hotel across from Hyde Park,"" writes Marjorie Wordingham of Mequon, Wisconsin. ""I had the most delicious salmon with Thai-style vegetables and rice at its restaurant, The Conservatory."""
5013030~I know, I know. This sounds crazy, right? Well, you just have to trust me on this one. The cantaloupe breaks down to form the backbone of a sweet, creamy sauce scented with pancetta and marjoram. A sleeper but a keeper, for sure.
5014312~Highly recommended!
5013032~A flavorful, colorful vegetarian stew that's as beautiful as it is easy to make. Rice on the side makes the dish complete and soaks up all those great flavors.
5013033~Highly recommended!
5013034~Apricot season is short, but our love for the fruit endures. Pan-roasting canned apricots revives their tartness. Combined with frangipane filling, they make for one sweet dream in the middle of winter.
5013035~These hors d'oeuvres are light, flaky and absolutely addictive. They are also simple to prepare and make a big impression — just what you want in party food.
5013036~"During the developing and testing process for this book, this dish became Hubby's new favorite. Totally unexpected—I was sure he'd steal a line from the kids and say, ""Thank you anyway, but this is not my taste."" (We taught them to say that instead of ""Ooo, yick!"") It's just not the usual stuff and spices he goes for, but apparently the combination was soooo his taste. And mine, too. It's one of those winner recipes that will make you dance around your kitchen. You may hug me now."
5013037~These pretty cookies are a cross between an almond horse shoe cookie and a Linzer cookie. Blackberry or apricot jam would also be delicious.
5013038~Highly recommended!
5013039~These sweet ribbons are the perfect way to turn carrot cupcakes into edible presents.
5013040~"The eight days of Hanukkah, the Jewish celebration of lights, honor the sacred lamp in the Holy Temple, which burned for eight days even though it only contained enough oil for one. Traditionally, many Hanukkah foods celebrate the oil in addition to the light. One of the most common is the jelly doughnut, known as sufganiyah. The word derives from the Hebrew word for ""sponge,"" an apt description for the texture of the doughnuts. I think they are more accurately ""pillowy."""
5013041~If you can't find white peaches and nectarines, this dessert would also be lovely made with the yellow varieties.
5013042~NOTE You will probably have some brisket left over (unless your friends eat like mine!). It reheats beautifully and is also great for sandwiches and hash.
5013043~Nothing is more majestic than this regal cut of meat — and nothing makes your house smell better while it roasts. Here, pork's natural sweetness is coaxed forward by the herbs and onions in the stuffing. And the crispy, savory bones are a delightful bonus. You will have to special-order this cut of meat (the rib portions of the loins are joined to form a circle) from your butcher.
5013044~These are great with maple syrup, honey, marmalade, or even cottage cheese.
5013045~Lots of oozy cheese and garlic make these vegetarian heros hearty enough to satisfy the most ardent carnivore.
5013046~Highly recommended!
5018187~Feel free to experiment with other seasonings besides sumac, like lemon zest, za'atar, or crushed red pepper flakes.
5013048~"""Four-spices"" usually include four of five spices and are commonly used to season forcemeats for sausages and terrines. I include all five. This is one combination of spices that I try to keep on hand in small quantities. This recipes is a suggestion; quantities and proportions given are typical but not written in stone. Vary the amounts to suit your own palate."
5013049~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5013050~Cooking the brussels sprouts in two stages for this recipe ensures that the cores will be tender and the outer leaves will still have bite.
5013051~This method of preparing a turkey should result in a tender, juicy bird so perfectly cooked, with skin so crisp and tasty, you might never eat roasted turkey again.

5013053~Highly recommended!
5013054~The warm caramel flavors in cola complement the molasses and brown sugar in this cake. The remaining candied kumquats are delicious served over vanilla ice cream. For best results, use Philadelphia-brand cream cheese in the frosting.
5013055~(Adapted from The Keeper's House)
5013056~Breading gives skinless fillets oomph, and a quick sauté cooks them through.
5013057~My son's teachers beg me to make this cake for his snack day at school. It isn't too sweet, and it has a moist, dense texture from the carrots and pineapple. It's also one of my most popular cakes at weddings and parties. When I make it at home, I throw more things into the batter—for example, a handful of pumpkin seeds or toasted pecans if I have them lying around. The beauty of this recipe is that you can increase the spices or omit the nuts, and it will still taste great.
5013058~Try these for both dessert and breakfast. They're great with their pan juices or the Apple Custard Sauce.
5013059~In this new take on the Caesar, fried eggs top the salad, and fish sauce replaces the usual anchovy fillets.
5013060~Highly recommended!
5013061~This elegant, light salad is ideal to serve as a first course. Pink grapefruit and peppery watercress cut the richness of avocado, and a scattering of toasted hazelnuts and hazelnut oil in the dressing suggest a flavor of early fall. Prosciutto is a graceful inclusion, but you can leave it out for a lighter vegetarian salad if you like.
5013062~Highly recommended!
5013063~Youll need a 7 3/4-inch-diameter trifle dish that is at least 4 3/4 inches deep. The recipe makes an extra gingerbread cake; have it for breakfast the next morning. If you prefer to make 12 individual trifles, use all three gingerbread cakes and cut each in half horizontally. Using a pretty glass as a guide, cut out 4 cake rounds from each cut cake layer. Alternate 2 cake rounds with 2 to 3 layers of the mascarpone cream, a few candied kumquats, and some poached cranberries in each glass.
5013064~Highly recommended!
5013065~Sprinkle these simple cookies with sanding sugar and serve them with ice cream. Or leave off the sugar and serve with tea for a more savory option.

5013069~"""Cooking with friends — that's pretty much what my life has been about,"" writes Louise Pickerel of Muskogee, Oklahoma. ""When I moved here from Texas ten years ago, it was hard to leave the people I'd known for so long, but I've probably met two hundred new people since then. I have always entertained, but now that I'm retired, I finally have more time to play bridge and cook."""
5013070~This is it, the decadent pie that seduced the seductive Marilyn Monroe. She simply couldn't get enough of it. Patch brought this recipe with him from Arkansas, where it was named for his sister Milton.
5013071~Editor's note: Use this gluten-free flour mixture to make Jeanne Sauvages' Spritz Cookies or Sufganiyot (Jelly Doughnuts).
5013072~This fresh, colorful soup makes a great summer starter.
5013073~Highly recommended!
5013074~I understand why Brussels sprouts top the list of detested vegetables for many people. When they are large, old, or overcooked, they tend to have an obnoxious, barnyardy flavor that some people are sensitive to whereas others are not. You can minimize this by choosing smaller, fresh-looking sprouts and cooking them just until they are crunchy-tender and bright colored. (Do not use frozen sprouts.) The secret of this dish is balancing ingredients to mellow the strong flavor of these miniature cabbages. Olive oil, garlic, red pepper, Parmesan, and, especially, nutmeg do the trick admirably.
5013075~There are no secrets to this burger recipe—this is simply a burger I like to cook on my grill, and then eat with a cold beer while watching the surf roll in.
5013076~This refreshing drink uses nonfat plain yogurt that is frozen before it is added to the blender. The yogurt should be frozen at least 6 hours ahead.
5013077~While traditional couscous with its exotic spices is the stuff of cold winter nights, I love that the same spices—ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin—can make a cool couscous salad that's perfect on even the sultriest days. My favorite go-along is grilled chicken, but the salad is also good with grilled fish. When I've got leftover couscous, I spoon it onto a bed of lightly dressed greens, surround it with slices of tomato (and sometimes hard-boiled eggs), and call it lunch.
5013078~Highly recommended!
5013079~Sweeten movie night by whipping up a batch of these treats for your friends. Cherries and oat flour add fiber to make them extra filling.

5013081~Why buy this classic steak rub when you can make it yourself? Inspired by the flavors of pastrami, this rub is good on more than just steaks—try rubbing it on chicken, salmon, or even broccoli before grilling or pan-roasting.
5013082~Active time: 25 min Start to finish: 45 min
5013083~Curried Potatoes and Spinach in Naan
5013084~This dessert traditionally should have twelve different fruits to represent the Apostles. But as long as you have a good variety, it will be delicious.
5013085~Of course, you can just roast a chunk of pork loin and spoon tapenade over it, but when you stuff the tapenade inside the roast, it will look all swirled and magical when sliced. It’s not that hard to do, really—two strategic cuts, a smear, a row of knotted strings—more basic butchery than brain surgery.
5013086~Highly recommended!
5013087~No southern holiday meal would be complete without sweet potatoes, and this simple twist on old-fashioned candied yams, with the addition of molasses and an orange's juice and zest, tastes bright and full of nuance.
5013088~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5013089~The joy of this simple dessert is that it is even better at room temperature, so you can make it in advance with ease. Be sure to pull it from the oven when the egg mixture is just set, so that the luscious cooked plum texture can meld perfectly with the batter. Think of it as a thick fruit pancake cooked effortlessly in the oven while you do other things.
5015022~Highly recommended!
5013091~Highly recommended!
5013092~This stuffing is based on ingredients prevalent throughout the Midwest. Michigan dried cherries are often used to accent dishes in that state, while prunes, raisins and dried currants are often found in many sweet and savory recipes from Ohio and Indiana. Using only three tablespoons of butter for ten servings makes this dish low in fat, too.
5013093~At the lodge, the tenderloin is also complemented by a spicy peach salsa.
5013094~This lovely and satisfying main course uses light coconut milk, Thai red curry paste and jalapeño chili for lots of flavor and spice.

5013108~Lingonberries grow wild in forests all over Scandinavia — they have a tartness similar to cranberries but with an earthy, pinelike undertone.
5013109~Serve white rice with saffron on the side, and orange sorbet topped with chocolate shavings for dessert. Look for the herbes de Provence in the spice aisle at the market.

5013116~Thick, herby chimichurri is a great sauce to add to your cooking repertoire. Serve it with grilled meats or sausages, toss it with roasted potatoes, brush it on bread before grilling, or pair it with fried eggs.
5013117~We took the traditional Jamaican jerk spice and simplified it. Before you call the authenticity police, give it a try on roast chicken legs.
5013118~Blue Lake is a stringless variety found at farmers' markets and specialty foods stores. Others work well, too, as long as they're fresh and tender.
5013119~It used to be that beets were sent to the market without the greens, which had been discarded. Now both are sold, often separately. Your best bet is to buy beets that have the greens intact; that way, you can partner this unique sweet and savory pasta with the perfect side dish: roasted fresh beets.
5013120~Ripe heirloom tomatoes and sharp cheddar cheese are a match made in heaven in this savory pie.
5013121~Involtini di Manzo

5013123~Coconut milk, coconut extract, and rum give the soufflés a slightly tropical note. The vivid crimson sauce looks beautiful with the white soufflés.
5013124~This creamy alternative to eggnog gets an extra dose of richness from crème de cacao.
5013125~Tomatillos are the key ingredient in this alluring green sauce. They have an unusual and pleasant tartness that works well with a variety of dishes. I pair this mojo with a grand Fish in Foil . The sauce has the brightness of a lemon with the attendant complexity you'd expect of the other ingredients that go into making it.
5013126~Highly recommended!
5013127~Highly recommended!
5013128~(Spicy Chicken Crêpes)
5013129~Tom Yum is made so many different ways that no two batches are really ever alike. Simultaneously spicy, tart, and sweet, this soup grows on you the more you eat it. Try it along with rice to cut some of the heat, or eat it throughout a meal for a welcome contrast.
5013130~These are best served warm.
5013131~Highly recommended!
5013132~What to drink: Fruity, soft red wines — such as Merlot and some Zinfandels — work well with the mustard glaze and ham.
5013133~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.

5013135~Delicious over vanilla ice cream.

5013228~Traditionally tortillas are heated a few at a time on a hot comal, or griddle, for a few seconds on either side and stacked as heated in a cloth-lined tortilla basket with a cover. The oven method we recommend here is useful for heating many tortillas at once.
5013139~Bruschetta — a rustic Italian canapé — is the perfect vehicle for the robust flavors of late summer. Serve these topped toasts as a first course or, with a salad and a glass of wine, as a light supper.
5013140~Highly recommended!
5013141~Sliced leftover cooked pork makes this quick pizza even quicker.
5013142~Tender, rich, and browned on top, this easy potato gratin gets loads of flavor from a very minimal amount of blue cheese that is added at the last minute.
5017883~Ultra-thin and wonderfully crisp, these cookies pack plenty of flavor into a slim package. We like to pair them with the prunes in wine or the orange tapioca pudding, but they're also wonderful on their own or with a hot cup of coffee.
5019757~These individual cakes, from Lantern pastry chef Monica Segovia-Welsh, are moist, tender, and not remotely fussy. If you dont want to fool with the suggested accompaniments, serve the cakes with a dollop of whipped cream instead.
5013278~Highly recommended!
5013146~The last embellishment for the caramel pecan cakes is easy to make and adds beautiful brightness to the plate.
5013147~"We were enchanted by Segovia-Welshs idea of cold ice cream flavored with ""warming"" spices such as those found in the fragrant Chinese blend called five-spice powder. It turns the honest little caramel pecan cakes into something suave."
5013578~Highly recommended!
5013149~A fruity flavor and mellow heat make ancho chile — poblano chile in its dried form — a delicious and unusual addition to the sweetness of ripe peaches and raspberries.

5013152~Highly recommended!
5014945~Turkey may not have played as big a part in the first Thanksgiving, held back in 1621, as it does in our contemporary celebration. If turkey was served at all, it was probably one of many game birds, that were served along with venison, oysters, clams, lobsters, and eels, as well as succotash, beach plums, sweet potatoes, leeks and cornbread. My own Thanksgiving menu is intended to pay homage to the foods of the first Thanksgiving , as well as to the foods that have become associated with this holiday. I believe that holidays by their own nature demand that traditional foods be served. In America, there is no stronger correlation between the food and the day than that of the venerable Thanksgiving Day turkey.
5013154~A topping of buttery whole-wheat bread crumbs and hazelnuts creates a toasty counterpoint to baked thick-sliced tomatoes. What prevents it from being too rich, though, is the accent of thyme—lemon thyme in particular. With its small green leaves edged in yellow, the herb is easy to spot at the farmers market. Still not sure? Take a sniff. Lemon thyme's brisk, citrusy scent is a real eye-opener.
5013155~"""Last year my family spent the holidays on the Big Island of Hawaii,"" writes Jo Lucarz of Phoenix, Arizona. ""One afternoon we ate lunch in Kamuela at the Parker Ranch Grill, where we had the best chili ever — and coming from a group of Arizona natives, that's saying a lot."""

5013157~Highly recommended!
5013158~The stacking and Asian fusion of this dish is very 1990s. But don't worry about its trendiness: Heady wallops of curry and ginger make this beautiful preparation timeless.
5013159~Only a culture that loves food could have come up with multiple techniques for cooking the cardoon—this thistle (a cousin of the artichoke that also tastes like one) with the texture of overgrown celery requires meticulous preparation. But the fact that Italians and Italian-Americans alike scour the markets for it come fall is evidence enough that it's worth it. A light coating and deep-frying really enhance the vegetable's subtle flavor.
5013160~A roly-poly is a traditional British dessert similar to an American jelly roll. In this version, the scone-like pastry is spread with tangysweet raspberry and rhubarb jam, then baked.

5013168~Traditional Indian recipes for basmati rice call for soaking the rice, but we find that it isn't necessary in this case.
5013169~An herb crust and special Zinfandel sauce give new meaning to the word flavorful. What to drink: A full-bodied, tannin-rich Bordeaux or Cabernet Sauvignon.
5013170~Packed with springtime vegetables, this meal is a quick fix for the winter blues.
5013171~This South Indian dish—also known as xec-xec—is full of tamarind, cumin, coriander, and roasted coconut. The spices meld with the tomato to form a flavorful sauce that clings to the shrimp.

5013173~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5013174~Classic Highballs called for club soda and a spirit, but over the years included sweeter mixers (the gin and tonic is one such version; the Moscow Mule, another). We suggest a return to the dry version, which allows premium spirits to shine.

5013177~Chef Tom Kearney is always trying to deliver something fresh and unexpected in a familiar package. “I love the homespun aspect of it, the familiarity of the meatballs—but they deliver the flavor of lamb,” he says. This recipe makes excellent use of all those dried herbs in your spice rack; the flavors really hold their own during the cooking process and shine through in every bite.
5013178~Highly recommended!
5013179~This surprisingly rich-tasting custard has much less fat than the classic version made with egg yolks. In another twist, we call for vin santo instead of the conventional choice, Marsala.

5013183~Ripe summer tomatoes are perfect just as they are. Simply chop them up, mix with jarred peppers and a few other ingredients, and you've got dinner. For a vegetarian supper, round out the meal with an assortment of cheeses and crackers. Craving something a little more substantial? A platter of smoked salmon, relishes, and breadsticks would be great with the soup. For dessert, offer figs drizzled with honey.

5013185~Soba noodles can be found in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.
5013186~A healthy dose of olive oil gives this rosemary-infused bread a rich, moist crumb and pale golden hue; it also helps it keep a little better than other European-style breads. Among other things, this is a wonderful and unconventional loaf for sandwiches.
5013187~Brownie-like cakes are layered with malt-fudge sauce, chocolate-malt crumbs, and charred marshmallows in this Dr. Seuss-like dessert. To help support the sweet structure, the dessert is assembled in a springform pan. Timing note: The assembled cake needs to chill overnight and has to stand at room temperature for a few hours before serving.
5013188~A splash of vodka or gin transforms this lively punch into a festive cocktail.
5013189~The beauty of this American classic is its adaptability, as it can be almost endlessly enhanced. If you wish, use one of the variations below or experiment to create your own specialty.

5013195~Serve the fish with steamed rice and braised bok choy or Napa cabbage for an elegant and easy Asian-inspired dinner. Begin marinating the fish at least three hours before you plan to cook it.
5013196~At Luca this is prepared in individual dishes. For a family-style dinner, double the recipe and prepare it in one large baking dish. Use your favorite marinara recipe or a purchased sauce.
5013197~If you don't have fresh salmon, canned salmon is a perfectly fine stand-in.
5013198~To prevent cut artichokes from browning, work with 1 artichoke at a time and lightly toss it in the lemon dressing as you go.

5013200~"Made from yuca (pronounced ""YOO-ca""), pearl tapioca can be found at Asian markets and specialty foods shops."
5013201~Blended drinks called batidas (or licuados) are served at fruit bars throughout Latin America. Milk or freshly squeezed orange juice is used as the base, then fruit is added and the mixture is blended to the consistency of a thick shake. Batidas are often enjoyed as a mid-morning or afternoon snack, but they're also delicious as cocktails later in the day. We tried various kinds of sugar to rim the glasses — from coarse crystals of sanding sugar to small grains of granulated sugar — and the only difference is in the appearance.
5013202~Blanching the mustard greens and kale ahead of time both softens them up and helps keep their color.

5015052~This recipe was created to accompany Honeydew in Cardamom Lime Syrup with Vanilla Cream.
5013205~(GELATO DI FRAGOLLA)
5013206~A good bread salad soaks up the juices from the tomatoes, olive oil, vinegar, and all the other seductive flavors that go into a really top-flight panzanella, and I love it! The tomatoes should be at their juicy, high-summer peak and the bread bakery-fresh, with a pleasingly soft crumb and chewy crust. My recipe not only calls for the best tomatoes and bread, but also relies on green, fruity, extra virgin olive oil, zesty red wine vinegar, salty capers, and freshly grated lemon zest. (I use a microplane when I zest citrus fruit and I highly recommend you do the same.) I also add other vegetables such as red onion, bell peppers, and fennel, garden-fresh basil, and some inky black olives for a salad bursting with summer.
5013207~In this free-form tart, the filling is mounded in the center of the pastry and the edges are simply folded up around it.
5013208~I love kimchi. To me, the world is a better place when we all enjoy kimchi. Fiery and fun, it gives a kick to all food.
5013209~Try packaged Asian rice mix (or steamed white rice), and tomato and cucumber salad sprinkled with seasoned rice vinegar. To end, spoon sliced fruits over mango sorbet. Look for the horseradish paste in the Asian foods section or next to the packaged sushi.
5013210~The combination of creamy ricotta, sweet fruit, rich olive oil, and a little salt is addictive. We'll be serving this for breakfast, brunch, and dessert all summer.

5013215~Crudités and dip are party staples. Choose whatever seasonal veggies you like, but mix up the colors. Some veggies, such as carrots and peppers, can be served raw, while others, like zucchini and asparagus, should be blanched but still have a slight crunch. There's nothing sexy about a limp piece of asparagus! And keep the vegetables separate—it makes it easier to refill the platters.
5013216~Protein-packed chickpeas and feta satisfy you for hours; bell pepper offers immunity-enhancing vitamin C.
5014049~The jerk seasoning can be made a day in advance. The chicken needs to marinate for at least four hours and can sit as long as overnight.

5013228~Traditionally tortillas are heated a few at a time on a hot comal, or griddle, for a few seconds on either side and stacked as heated in a cloth-lined tortilla basket with a cover. The oven method we recommend here is useful for heating many tortillas at once.

5013267~Most people think of ambrosia salad as a cloud of chunky white fruit in a glass bowl with neatly arranged canned mandarins on top. But we've evolved from those dark ages, and it's high time this salad got a makeover. Ambrosia can be reeeaally delicious, if made with the best, freshest ingredients. If you are even thinking about using dried coconut flakes from a bag, don't bother with this. Sweet fresh coconut meat is what makes it a standout.
5013268~Highly recommended!
5013269~Since the beans need to soak overnight, be sure to begin one day ahead. Spicy Italian sausage is a good substitute for the chorizo.
5017397~This Middle Eastern spice mixture is so delicious we suggest doubling the recipe and using the extra for a snack: Dunk some bread (such as pita) in flavorful olive oil and then in the za'atar. Or sprinkle za'atar over plain yogurt and drizzle with olive oil, and you've got a terrific dip.

5013297~Soft pretzels, sliced German sausages, pickled garden vegetables, and roasted Brussels sprouts can all be dipped in this oozy cheese sauce for one amusing wintertime party. Swiss Alpine-style cheeses are the best choice for fondue, given their earthy, robust flavor and excellent melting quality. Substitute any easy-melting cheese for the Gruyère found in this recipe. Raclette, Emmentaler, Cheddar, Fontina, and Gouda are all delicious choices, and can be blended for a more complex flavor.

5013329~This sandwich gets a toasty power-up from your grill pan. Melted mozzarella bolsters chicken cutlets, and its gooey richness is offset by the fiery spark of cherry peppers. A tomato-basil salad rounds out the meal.
5013330~Bourbon lends depth to the sauce and extra sweetness to the cream filling, but this dessert is fantastic even without it.
5013331~There are so many things to love about this fast technique, which nods to the French confit method of cooking meat in its own fat. You'll get about 40 strips of par-cooked bacon that get crispy in mere minutes. And delicious bacon-flavored oil you can use to make a vinaigrette or cook pancakes. But the best part is the shape of the bacon itself—it cooks up like a child's drawing of bacon—long, red, flat strips that don't curl and are perfect for sandwiches or alongside fluffy clouds of scrambled eggs.

5013365~Thin ribbons of Parmigiano-Reggiano carry the mushrooms' meaty robustness through each bite of greens. It might look like a lot of mushrooms when you're putting the salad together, but it allows everyone to have a generous helping.

5013372~Of all the great American cookouts, surely the lobster bake, known outside of Maine as the clambake, is the most dramatic. The technique, learned from the original Americans, uses a steaming pit either dug in the sand or made from natural rock formations to cook a wide variety of ingredients without relying on forged pots and pans. The presentation, the most spectacular I have ever seen, is a ten-foot-tall burst of steam released upon removal of the tarp. As the steam subsides, bright red lobsters facing back to back on dark green rockweed come into view. Sweet corn surrounds the lobsters. Underneath the seaweed lie buried treasures: soft-shell clams, rock crabs, a whole fish, mussels, periwinkles, potatoes, boiling onions, sausage and hen or duck eggs. The sights and smells are intoxicating. The lobster bake, much more than a dish or even a feast, embodies a day filled with the wonders of water, fire, food, family and friends.

5013374~Rice sticks are a magic trick in a bag: Crumble them into hot oil and they poof instantly into crispy, twisty little morsels of browned, puffed rice—ready in seconds to serve as a crunchy topping for bite-sized pieces of quick-cooked chicken, broccoli, and almonds.
5013375~Highly recommended!
5013376~In every good restaurant kitchen, there's a combination of thrift and innovation. We always have a dish like this chowder on the menu because when we portion fish for main courses, there are inevitably some pieces of our excellent, sushi-quality fish too small to serve on their own. And that is another great reason to buy your fish whole: not only can you save the bones and head for fish stock, but you'll be generating two meals from one shopping trip.
5013377~Though not quite as tender, lamb shoulder chops have deeper flavor than rib chops and won't break the bank.
5013378~"Dottie Stubel of Marietta, Georgia, writes: ""While on a trip to Hilton Head Island, my husband and I ate at the Spartina Grill. Everything was phenomenal, but we especially enjoyed the tomato-crab bisque."""
5013379~"Before I had children, I swore up and down that I'd never be one of those parents kowtowing to the little picky eaters' preferences at mealtimes. And then I had actual children. I'm no parenting expert, but my personal studies have shown that anytime you can legitimately make a meal out of a cookie and milk, you're golden. As it happens, grown-ups won't turn these down, either. And, bonus! When made with flax ""eggs"" and gluten-free oats, these wholesome gems are vegan and gluten-free."
5013380~Parcooking in vinegar water helps set the starches so the potatoes get crisp, rather than floury, when roasted.
5013381~You can start making these savory cookies up to three days ahead. Even easier: Serve the cheese roll with store-bought crackers. (We especially liked this roulade made with a spiced cranberry-apple chutney, but any thick chutney will work.)

5013394~At the Princeville Hotel on the Hawaiian Island of Kauai, a mixture of dried and fresh fruits is used to fill the pork. Begin preparing this dish one day before serving.

5013398~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018633~When you're ready to slice these eggs, be sure to wipe your knife clean between every cut or you'll get the pink pickling liquid smeared on the yolk.
5013400~A thoroughly modern take on the classic baked potato with sour cream.
5013401~Removing all but a strip of the eggplant's skin lets the flesh meld with the sauce without falling apart.
5013402~Cumin and time over the coals give these hearty thick-cut pork chops deep flavor. A spicy-sweet tropical salsa made with fresh pineapple balances the dish.
5013403~Ribs are among the constants on the world's barbecue trail, but just how theyre prepared reflects a strong regional and cultural bias. The vast ranch lands and forests of the New World, for example, led to American-style barbecue, with its large slabs of spareribs slow-roasted on a smoker for the better part of a day. Asians adopted a different strategy: cooking small cuts or single ribs on tiny grills engineered for fuel efficiency. The flavor would come not from wood smoke (Asians don't have wood to burn by the cord), but from the explosively flavored seasoning indigenous to the region, like lemongrass, ginger, and fish sauce. Case in point: These Cambodian-style ribs, from Sarun Pich, a chef at the Amansara resort in Siem Reap, Cambodia.
5013990~This recipe is an accompaniment for Vanilla Mousse Meringues and Fresh Berries.
5013405~Good as a side dish or meatless entráe.
5015480~There's no doubt these are some seriously cheesy biscuits, but dill adds a dose of herbal brightness, making them the ideal partner for grits with rosemary bacon (page 61) and fried eggs.
5013407~When the raw slices are baked, they will shrink considerably, so use large beets.
5013790~This punch — containing rum, Cognac, and peach brandy — is potent. If it packs a bit too much of a wallop for your taste, you can dilute it with cold black tea, a common mixer for this particular punch, or with seltzer water, for a bit of fizz. Some punch bowls may not be big enough to accommodate the size ice block we call for — feel free to use other freezing containers that are more suitably shaped. And though the block is a classic part of this recipe, you can, of course, simply serve the punch in a pitcher over ice cubes.
5013409~The inspiration for this recipe came from a tea sandwich one of our food editors discovered at Alice's Tea Cup, in Manhattan. It's surprisingly substantial — a bit like an overstuffed deli sandwich, but not nearly as heavy.
5013410~Highly recommended!
5013411~The ginger, coconut milk, curry paste, basil and cilantro in this are often used in Southeast Asian curries. Sautéing the chicken strips in olive oil adds a Western touch. For a nice finale, serve mango sorbet with canned lychees, small Chinese fruits available in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets.
5013412~(Stir-Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp)
5013413~Be sure to start the brisket at least a day before you plan on serving it - although it can be made up to three days ahead.
5013414~If any cake could be called refreshing, this would be the one. Rich but light, it loses absolutely nothing from the absence of white flour.
5013415~Now that imported caviar is no longer available, the domestic stuff is all the rage. Paired with lemon oil (sold at many markets), it's the ultimate garnish.
5013416~Highly recommended!
5013417~A bit of blue cheese in each patty ups the chicken's savoriness without adding much fat or calories.
5013418~In honor of the late Peggy Lee, we adapted the classic Peggy cocktail, dubbing it Fever, as a touch of Dubonnet gives this drink the faintest pink blush.

5013420~Shih Tzu Tou
5013421~Serve this pilaf-like dish with mango chutney and cold yogurt.
5013422~What is a country salad? In my mind it is a thoughtful blend of greens — Lola Rosa, frisée, red oak leaf, tatsoi, endive, mâche, arugula, and mizuna — combining different tastes and textures, topped with a ripe cheese and an artisanal cured ham, and garnished with seasonal fruit and vegetables. A well-balanced vinaigrette and spiced walnuts make it impossible to resist.
5013423~Try this rich sauce over pasta or over the <a></a> Parmesan Polenta Squares
5013424~Sweet caramelized onions and pungent blue cheese make a good pair in this simply elegant appetizer.
5013425~Super-easy to make and packed with flavor. Look for panko in the Asian foods section of the supermarket.
5013426~Always cool the stuffing completely before filling the turkey.
5013427~This appetizer is traditionally made with friselle (ring-shaped rolls). Friselle are baked twice, giving the rolls a very crunchy texture. To soften the bread slightly, it's dipped in water and brushed with olive oil before serving. When Donatella was growing up, her family would put bowls of water and olive oil on the table with the friselle so that everyone could dip their own bread. If friselle aren't available, toasted ciabatta is an easier-to-find substitute.

5013431~In theory, campfire s'mores are amazing, but the reality is often a stale graham cracker sandwich filled with thick pieces of unmelted chocolate and gooey marshmallows oozing out the sides. This sandwich cookie makes your s'mores dreams come true. The honey and cinnamon-spiked soft cookie is big enough to hold not one, but two toasted marshmallows, and the thin chocolate coating melts perfectly inside.
5013432~Here's a real showstopper, with an exotic touch of cardamom. To crush the cardamom, place the seeds in a resealable plastic bag and tap with a rolling pin.
5013433~Cooked dried chickpeas are firmer and more flavorful than canned.
5013434~One slice of this classic dessert can pack 480 calories, 22 grams fat and 35 g sugar. (No, that's not á la mode.) Crust in time for the holidays.

5013438~Using his artist's eye, food editor and stylist Paul Grimes transformed the usual free-form summer tomato salad into a showstopping terrine with structure and elegance. A homemade vegetable broth is the base for the delicate aspic in which the curves of tomato, arranged by color, are suspended.
5013439~Highly recommended!
5013440~Fresh cantaloupe + coconut make for the perfect summer cocktail.
5013441~We recommend french fries and a watercress and pickled beet salad as accompaniments; try chocolate cupcakes for dessert.

5013443~This dip is also nice with raw vegetables.
5013444~Highly recommended!
5013445~You can stuff five or six healthy vegetables into salsa (tomatoes, peppers, scallions, garlic, corn, whatever else is left in the crisper bin) then use that salsa five or six different ways (on fish, on chicken, in a burrito or, of course, on a delicious corn chip. You can make salsa in minutes. It keeps forever. It is the antidote to any of your vegetable woes!

5013450~Editor's note: Use this recipe to make Chef David Chang's Bo Ssäm.
5020009~Fish deserve some salty foreplay just as much as pork and poultry. Every type of seafood is different in terms of density of the flesh, so different brine times are needed for different fish.
5013452~Highly recommended!
5013453~Highly recommended!
5013454~Sub spinach for kale if you like.
5013458~For this pasta dough, we used a mixture of cake and all-purpose flours. It's too delicate when you're making noodles, but it's great for filled, double-edged pastas like ravioli.
5013456~Red lentils, faster-cooking than other varieties of the legume, are the foundation of this earthy, rustic soup. Light but satisfying, it's a wonderful (and easy) start to an autumn meal.
5013457~I have had this served with chopped avocado, beans, rice, and all sorts. So please do feel free to include one (or all) of those as an accompaniment if you fancy it.
5013458~For this pasta dough, we used a mixture of cake and all-purpose flours. It's too delicate when you're making noodles, but it's great for filled, double-edged pastas like ravioli.
5013459~These crunchy, sweet-tart chips are addictive — you'll definitely want to make them as a snack. The preparation is particularly easy with a nonstick baking pad. If you decide to use parchment paper instead, be prepared for some chips to stick to it. When they do, return them to the oven for 3 minutes to soften.
5013460~The stew does need to bake for a couple of hours, but it's very easy to put together.
5017779~You may add 1/4 cup of lemon juice to this jam, right at the end, to give it a tart edge that sets off the flavor of the strawberries.
5013462~Here's a beautiful pie with a sweet-tart filling and a sensational crust.
5013463~Steam broccoli spears, then grill them alongside the hen. Couscous and a cucumber and yogurt salad complete the main course. For dessert, sprinkle raspberries and sliced nectarines with some sugar and a few toasted almonds.
5013464~"This sublime lemon dessert is the perfect antidote to all those chocolate bunnies and chocolate-stuffed eggs proliferating at Easter like, well…rabbits. It helps that our pudding is simple to make, too.
A seriously tart lemon curd—quickly cooked on top of the stove—is folded into sweetened whipped cream, which both tempers the tang and lightens the dessert with a suave silkiness. Crisp, airy wisps of meringue, lightly sprinkled with chopped pistachios and easily shaped and baked into cigars, are delightful on their own, but they're surprisingly efficient alternatives to spoons for delivering the pudding to your mouth."

5013466~Begin preparing the ribs one day ahead so that they can marinate overnight.
5013467~Highly recommended!
5013468~Backyard garden strawberries are often smaller than store-bought, so be the judge of how many strawberries you need for the skewers. Or even simpler, grill strawberries on a grill rack until a bit charred and warmed through and spoon atop frozen yogurt or ice cream.
5020015~These little toasts make a crisp base for savory toppings of eggplant and roasted peppers , chickpeas and mint , and sweet-and-sour onions . Mix and match as you please — if you prefer one topping over another, the recipes can easily be doubled.
5013470~Forget takeout—this satisfying Thai-inspired green curry is ready in just 20 minutes with a little help from a store-bought rotisserie chicken.
5013471~Highly recommended!
5013472~Highly recommended!
5013473~Try this fresh alternative to holiday ham for your next festive gathering or Sunday supper. With an apple cider brine and maple-mustard glaze, this pork loin has all the flavors of a classic ham wrapped in more a tender and juicy package. Start early—the brine takes 8–24 hours.
5013474~Highly recommended!
5013475~Plump scallops, sprinkled with salt and pepper, are lightly grilled and served with a salsa rich in parsley and diced vegetables. The salsa should be made just before eating; otherwise the liquid content of the vegetables will turn the dish watery.
5013476~A seasonal abundance of peas means more for everyone. This easy side dish keeps them snappy and fresh with aromatic tarragon and lemon zest.
5015520~Don't let the unexciting name of the recipe fool you—this ice cream is unusually good.
5013478~Highly recommended!
5013479~For this traditional Asian fondue, raw strips of chicken are cooked quickly at the table in a pot of boiling broth. Guests then place the cooked chicken strips on lettuce leaves, add noodles and whatever garnishes they choose, roll up the leaves and complete the packages with a bit of the Sweet-and-Spicy Dipping Sauce. When all of the chicken has been eaten, divide the remaining broth among the guests.

5013484~Creamy potatoes are baked in a casserole.
5013485~The flavorful butter adds plenty of zip.
5013486~Fragrant bits of aggressively seasoned lamb and heaps of fresh herbs transform ordinary lentils into the pantry party kid.
5013487~Sprinkle shredded cheddar over some tortilla chips, and pop them under the broiler for a minute-you'll have instant first-course nachos. All you need with the salad is a basket of tortillas or crusty bread. Mix some cinnamon into chocolate pudding to wrap up this Mexican-style dinner.
5013488~Be sure to drain the salad before adding to the sandwich.
5018035~Although it's a perfect complement to pork, this chutney would also be tasty served with other roasted meats.
5018458~This dough is easy to handle and will give you a crispy crust that's also tender.
5013491~Fresh corn from a farmers' market or a grower's farmstand will taste the sweetest.
5013492~If you really want to go all out, you can brown the lamb in a wood-burning oven (erm, if you've got one handy) where it could absorb smoky flavors. For the rest of us mere mortals, that step for this recipe can be done in a hot oven.
5013493~Highly recommended!
5013494~Colorful, refreshing and delicious.
5013495~This dish takes just minutes to prepare, so steam some rice ahead of time. A salad of sliced radishes and sweet onions drizzled with a light vinaigrette rounds things out. For dessert, try vanilla frozen yogurt topped with sugared strawberries.
5013496~This version of clafouti is like a custard.
5013497~Highly recommended!
5015499~Highly recommended!
5013499~This delicious last course is a little sweet and a little savory—like dessert and a cheese plate in one dish. If you can't find fresh figs, buy dried black Mission figs, soak them in warm water until very soft, then drain and pat dry.
5013500~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5013501~To make the finished dish less of a knife-and-fork affair, remove the braised chicken from the bone, shred it with a couple of forks, and then stir it back into the tomato-kimchi sauce.
5013502~"""As a student at Bloomsburg University, I spent many Sunday afternoons at Russell’s restaurant in downtown Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania,"" writes Marganne Hoffman of Lebanon, Pennsylvania. ""A decade after graduating, I still crave their cheddar-crusted broccoli soup. I would be thrilled if the owners would share the recipe—and so would my family."""
5013503~Super-flavorful (and super-easy) homemade fresh chorizo and crispy hash brown potatoes take these tasty breakfast tacos to the next level.
5013504~The slightly sweet, almost flowery flavor of marjoram adds a delicate note to this Middle Eastern—inspired salad, though oregano is also fine. To be sure the eggplant is tender, slice into it before taking it off the grill—when properly done, it will be moist all the way through.
5013505~The stems from Swiss chard shouldn't be trashed; they add texture and a layer of flavor to any sauté.
5013506~Highly recommended!
5013507~To accompany Frozen Nougat Terrine .
5013508~L'Albatros brings a taste of France to Cleveland's University Circle neighborhood. Cassoulet, bouillabaisse—and even escargots—show up on the menu.

5013509~Highly recommended!
5013510~Mesquite seasoning is a spice blend sold in the spice section of many supermarkets.

5013515~Add corn biscuits (you can find them in the supermarket refrigerator case) and a romaine, arugula, and radicchio salad with goat cheese. Coffee ice cream drizzled with Kahlúa is a nice dessert.
5013516~Prized by gardeners during the Renaissance, celery root, or celeriac, has a light celery flavor and a dense flesh that is perfect for shredding into slaws. This salad is wonderful with the chicken and biscuits or the flank steak. Enjoy any leftovers the next day.
5013517~Yogurt curdles easily when heated, but mixing it with egg white and cornstarch, and then simmering it, makes the yogurt more heat-stable without changing the flavor significantly.

5013521~Editor's note: This recipe was created by chef Einat Admony for an Israeli Passover menu.
5013522~This small, round pasta is named for its resemblance to peppercorns, so why not pair it with black pepper, which, along with lemon, adds brightness to the parmesan?
5013523~If you prefer to grill the ribs — which will intensify the hoisin flavor — remove them from the marinade (do not bake) and grill them over medium heat until tender and lightly charred, turning often and basting occasionally with marinade, about 25 minutes. Look for chili-garlic sauce in the Asian foods section of supermarkets.
5013524~These cheesy grits are the perfect base for Veal Grillades or almost anything else.
5013525~Why settle for plain old ham and cheese when you can easily make this panini? You will have some roasted radicchio left over, which is fine since it makes a nice addition to a green salad and will keep a few days in the refrigerator.
5013526~Highly recommended!
5013527~Highly recommended!
5013528~Want super-crisp chicken without having to add much fat? Start with a room-temperature pan: As the skillet becomes hot, the chicken skin will gradually render its fat, becoming browned and crackling.

5013549~A quick, colorful and low-cal dessert. What else could you ask for?
5013550~Slow-cooked garlic combines with bacon and mushrooms to give this first-course pizza a smoky, woodsy and oh-so-satisfying flavor. Serve a crisp green salad alongside.
5013551~Homemade beef stock is richer and more flavorful than store-bought, adding lip-smacking depth to your soups, sauces, and braises. Freeze it by the quart and put it to work all winter long.

5013555~Pachadis are lightly cooked South Indian salads, often involving yogurt. This was my grandmother's recipe, and it remains a feature of my core repertoire because it's so simple and unusual at the same time. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.

5013559~Using a salad spinner makes short work of washing fresh spinach, which usually requires several changes of water. Start by filling the spinner bowl with water. Then fill the basket with spinach, submerge it in the water, and stir the spinach to release dirt. Lift the basket out and repeat with fresh water.
5013560~Pat: Broccoli in cornbread—who knew? But sometimes you need to go to great lengths, and be very crafty, to get your kids to eat more vegetables. The result in this instance is a moist, incredibly satisfying cornbread that gets added richness from both cottage and cheddar cheese. We call for frozen broccoli, which makes this recipe easy enough to whip together in the time it takes your oven to preheat. (You can also use 2 1/2 cups of fresh steamed broccoli.)
5014211~Highly recommended!
5013562~Zucchini bread is one of those things that is almost always good but rarely spectacular and a slice can serve as a breakfast, snack or dessert. Sprinkling it with sugar and grilling it so it becomes nicely caramelized moves it firmly in the dessert category (and, along with adding a spoonful of mascarpone, makes it much closer to spectacular).
5013563~This homespun loaf cake evokes the nut tree-covered hills of Avellino and the lemon-scented Amalfi coast. The cake batter is primarily ground raw nuts, generously flavored with lemon zest. The latter gives the finished cake a pronounced citrus flavor that pairs well with the orange salad.
5013564~Eben Freeman, bartender of Tailor Restaurant in New York City, developed this bubblegum-infused vodka cocktail. The drink gets its name from Bazooka bubblegum, but Freeman prefers to use Double Bubble because it gives the vodka better color and flavor. This recipe makes enough bubblegum-infused vodka for eight cocktails. If stored in an airtight container, the leftover vodka will last indefinitely.
5013565~Spinach and lowfat ricotta make it hearty—and good for you.

5015305~We love using preserved lemons in the BA kitchen, and Philip Krajeck's recipe makes the best we've ever tasted. They take 10 minutes to prep and need only two weeks to cure. Sure, you can buy preserved lemons at specialty stores, but when the end result is this good, we say make your own.
5013571~Arranging the carrots in a geometric pattern transforms this savory tart into a truly show-stopping side or appetizer, while a zesty carrot top salad provides a nice pop of color and flavor.

5013575~"The ""heavenly"" secret is a vanilla bean."

5013590~Olives, garlic, herbs, tomato, and wine come together in this short rib dish, a nod to the warm and sunny flavors of Provence. A shower of freshly grated orange zest at the finale brightens the rich braised beef with a citrus zing. This recipe makes a deeply satisfying main dish for Hanukkah or any other celebratory occasion.
5013591~"These small dumplings come with both a story and a significant history. According to legend, they were born in the imperial kitchen when a cook, making dumplings for the emperor, forgot a batch that was slowly cooking. They were singed brown, slightly burned. With no time to spare, and an impatient, hungry emperor waiting, the cook, a nimble and adaptive fellow, arranged the dumplings on a platter, burned sides up, and presented them to the emperor as a new dish that he called, quotie, which means ""stuck bottom."" The emperor was delighted. Legend or not, it is a fact that these browned half-moons filled with pork and vegetables were eventually sold daily by the thousands from small streetside stands to satisfy the morning habits of people in Beijing and Tianjin, who called them jiaozi, or ""little dumplings."" It is a tradition that exists to this day."
5013592~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5015356~Served warm or at room temperature, a frittata makes for an easy yet impressive dinner. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, buy 1 bunch asparagus and use 3/4 bunch for the Fettuccine with Asparagus, Beet Green Pesto, and Poached Egg and the remaining 1/4 bunch here. This is the perfect opportunity to use up any leftover beet green pesto from the pasta dish as well.

5013604~Barley gives this a wonderful chewy texture.
5013605~In keeping with the Greek flavor of this dish, James partners it with orzo, a rice-shaped pasta popular in Greek cooking.

5013621~Cooking peeled hard-boiled quail eggs in a mixture of water, soy sauce, and sugar creates lovely little tea-colored morsels that contrast firm whites with buttery yolks. A quarter teaspoon of sesame oil is all it takes to cast an alluringly nutty spell over the eggs.
5013622~Highly recommended!
5013623~"These cakes are great for parties because they can be completely assembled the day before and then quickly baked before serving, for the all-important ""ooze"" factor."
5013624~Spelt spaghetti has an incredible nutty taste and is a great alternative to regular spaghetti, as it's high in wheat bran fiber, or beta-glucans, which help keep our cholesterol levels in check.
5013625~Highly recommended!

5013629~You don't need a panini machine to make these; use the low-tech method of weighting the sandwiches with a baking pan filled with canned goods. If you're making just one or two sandwiches at a time, you can cook them in a skillet and top them with another skillet weighted with cans.
5013630~This appealing do-ahead dessert, perfect for a picnic, can be formed ahead and frozen. Just thaw, then bake and cool.
5015066~The ideal summer dinner—without the labor required for the traditional Spanish version.

5013637~Highly recommended!
5013638~Blended in the processor, the no-bake cream cheese filling is ultra-smooth.
5013639~The following corn bread is not to be eaten on its own; it's meant for stuffing, so we've deliberately made it dry.
5013640~Find rose-petal syrup at ethnic food shops (or online at Kalustyans)—it's a deep red-colored liquid commonly served in the eastern Mediterranean. For quick drinks, mix it with soda or milk. Be sure not to confuse this syrup with rose water, though.
5013641~Highly recommended!
5013642~Highly recommended!
5013643~This syrup is good to have on hand for making sorbets and certain cocktails. A plus: It keeps for a long time.
5014293~An homage to Denmark's sublime almond pastries, these delicate little cakes provide a nice hit of almond to complement the licorice pudding ; they're also a lovely nibble on their own with a cup of tea.
5013645~Melted butter laced with thyme, fennel seeds and lemon peel is drizzled over the chicken for terrific flavor. The fennel bulbs and bell peppers, both of which are also broiled, add a lot of color and taste. Pour a Sauvignon Blanc to accompany this dish.
5013646~Highly recommended!
5013647~We like vegetarian mains in summer; for a heartier dish, add shredded rotisserie chicken or sliced grilled steak.
5013648~Accompany this salad version of a BLT sandwich with grilled bread.
5013649~Sprightly bits of lemon zest and garlic punctuate this creamy mayonnaise-based egg salad. In place of the usual celery and onion, fennel lends an aromatic crunch.
5013650~Hold the marinara! For a change of pace, dress ravioli with a quick and creamy sauce that gets added taste and texture from tiny pieces of string beans and prosciutto.
5013651~Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 3 1/2 hr
5013652~A lovely white sangria with great balance. Make it a day ahead to allow the flavors to intensify.

5013654~Highly recommended!
5013655~Highly recommended!
5013656~Roasting the chickens and using both dark and white meat results in chicken salad with deep flavor. (Buying rotisserie chickens will cut down on the timing, but be sure to choose minimally seasoned birds.) Fennel, standing in for the usual celery, along with fennel seed and fresh basil, adds an unexpected note of sophistication.

5013663~These flavor-packed meatballs are delicious whether poached (like in our Sumo Stew (Chanko Nabe) with Shrimp, Meatballs, and Bok Choy), grilled, or baked.

5013671~"I thrive on discovering new flavor combinations, and Sea is a great example of a totally thrown together idea that worked out beautifully. That day I was really in the mood for some crab salad, but I wanted to do something untraditional. One of my purveyors had sent me some Tuscan cantaloupe to try, so I first made a melon emulsion. Then I tossed the crabmeat with my Colvin Vinaigrette (which is basically good on anything). I thought that avocado would be great with the melon, so I started with a little melon on the plate, then I layered sliced ripe avocado and the crab mixture with a huge quenelle of caviar I had on hand to top it all off. Honestly, it was like heaven. I had so much crab that I made two mini ones for my two friends downstairs, and they were like, ""What the hell is this flavor combination? This is amazing!"" Give it a try—it's elegant and just incredibly good."
5013672~Slightly bitter Swiss chard (which is a variety of beet) was reportedly named for the Swiss botanist who identified the green. In this dish, chard's earthy flavor balances out the rich, creamy béchamel sauce.

5013674~Highly recommended!
5013675~Italian and Swedish meatballs, step aside. These Turkish meatballs are so juicy, light, and flavorful—not to mention easy—they'll be rocking your party world this holiday season. And you've got to admit that hors d'oeuvre offerings can't get more festive than the accompanying pomegranate yogurt dip. If you can find labne (thick, Middle Eastern yogurt), use it. Strained whole-milk yogurt comes closer to the flavor of labne than Greek yogurt, but if you're short of time, Greek yogurt is a fine substitute.
5013676~Potatoes are a must on any bistro menu. Here, they are grated and layered with cheese to form a large pancake-like galette.

5013694~Highly recommended!
5013695~Roasted potatoes are pretty delicious all by themselves. But they're even better when you douse them with spicy mayo and a shower of umami-packed bonito flakes. You've probably seen these pink, feathery-looking shavings of smoked tuna in the ethnic section of the supermarket—and they're well worth taking home for this Asian take on surf and turf.

5013708~"We offer so many mouthwatering buttery, sugary, fruity, chocolaty sweet breakfast treats in the morning that it can be almost impossible to choose just one (""I'll have one of each"" is a common humorous request from new customers). That is, unless you're one of those people who need to start off the day with eggs or bacon or anything not sweet. For those customers, we've created the ultimate quick grab-'n'-go breakfast using items we already have in-house: brioche dough, cheese, breakfast meats, and eggs. The dough, after an overnight rest in the refrigerator during which it develops flavor, is stretched and pulled like you would a pizza dough to make a flat round."
5013709~Passion-Fruit Champagne Cocktail
5013710~We will avoid all Sex and the City references here, but the fact remains: This cocktail is classic for a reason.
5013711~Between the bacon (around 200mg of sodium per slice) and the scallops (over 330mg per 3 ounces), the classic dish is too salty for me to enjoy. But when the bacon is replaced with smoky zucchini ribbons and the scallops are swapped out for halibut rounds, you have a whimsical reinterpretation that actually tastes equally thrilling.
5019218~This is not a traditional chili and has no connection with any Mexican or Texas recipe. It was devised simply as an experiment and turned out to be delicious.
5015022~This recipe was created to prepare Herb and Bacon Corn Bread Stuffing and Sausage, Cranberry and Corn Bread Stuffing .
5013714~Anyone who has had a Long Island iced tea knows that it resembles iced tea in appearance and (to some extent) taste, but that the similarity ends there. A survey of the ingredients will remind you why.
5013715~Mustard, tarragon, and a touch of sugar flavor the pork and its accompanying slaw.
5013716~A boilermaker is a classic one-two drink consisting of a shot of whiskey followed by a beer chaser. Those ingredients also come together in this all-American barbecue sauce. Use it on ribs, pork chops, chicken, even burgers (brush it on during the last ten minutes of grilling). If making ribs, brush them often during the first part of cooking with a mixture of one part cider vinegar to ten parts water and a pinch of dried crushed red pepper; that will keep them moist. This recipe makes enough for three pounds of meat or poultry and can be doubled easily.
5013717~Make these little cakes using four 10-ounce mini-bundt pans (not non-stick). Ten-ounce ramekins would also work.
5013718~Also called pressed butter cookies, spritz are the perfect holiday cookie. They are simple to make with a cookie press, pretty to look at, and delicious to eat. This recipe makes about eight dozen. Yes, you read that right—eight dozen. And the cookies are quick to prepare and ideal for giving as gifts or bringing to cookie parties. You can serve the baked cookies plain or decorate them any number of ways. I like to slather melted chocolate between two cookies for an elegant sandwich cookie. It's also fun to drizzle melted chocolate over the tops. You can also sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar or decorate them with royal icing.

5013723~A few tips: At several points in the recipe, components need to be chilled for a while before you can proceed, so plan accordingly. In our test kitchen, Philadelphia-brand cream cheese gave consistently good results. Note, too, that the cake can be completely assembled, then frozen for up to one week.
5013724~This is creamy corn with no cream at all. Our trick? The juice of freshly cut corn thickened with cornstarch.
5013725~The choice of fresh fruit depends entirely on what's available, so don't be afraid to experiment. Mangoes, pineapples, apples, and strawberries are some fruits to consider, although the drink should include at least one citrus fruit, just for some zing.
5013726~While in Costa Rica, Boston chef Steve Johnson was inspired to make fish cakes from leftover red snapper and boiled yuca. The combination takes clever advantage of the vegetable's starchy character, which binds the cakes together while allowing the flavor of the snapper to come through cleanly. We prefer to use frozen yuca, which has a better consistency and is easier to prepare.
5013727~Though Rose Pascale always uses fresh octopus (sold as pulpo in many Latino markets), we found that it's generally sold frozen. You may need to special-order or reserve octopus from your local fish market several days ahead.

5013739~One of the most popular items on the Tanoreen menu, this tower of crispy pesto-marinated eggplant slices spread with smoky baba ghanouj, just might be the dish that inspired me to write this cookbook. It draws on the flavors of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, but the truth is, I created it to encourage my son to eat eggplant. He always loved fried zucchini sticks, so I cut eggplant in the same shape and he was none the wiser (although here they're cut in rounds). This is a good example of how I have taken advantage of ingredients that are available to me in the States and married them with the classic preparations from my childhood.
5013740~Inspired by custom-made Indian snacks sold all over Chowpatty Beach.
5013741~Country bread and a salad of thickly sliced tomatoes sprinkled with oil, vinegar and crumbled bacon complete the supper. Strawberry tarts make a lovely finale.

5019338~It's unusual to butter and flour the pan when making a chiffon cake, but we liked the delicate crust that resulted. Because we did it this way, the cake must be cooled, inverted, on a rack, not on a bottle (the usual procedure for chiffons), or it will fall right out of the pan!
5013757~Swordfish or lamb —guests can choose just one kind of kebab or both. (Chicken can be substituted for the lamb, if you prefer.) The same quick marinade flavors the kebabs, then gets reduced to a sauce for serving alongside.

5013787~The killer combination of coconut, almonds, and milk chocolate makes for a delectable candy bar. One of the most iconic of American candies, the Almond Joy, is famous for its creamy coconut filling topped with almonds and covered in milk chocolate. Its sibling, the Mounds bar, has the same coconut center but no almonds. Although the recipes for these two candies are top secret, it's possible to make wonderfully coconutty chocolate candies in your own home.
5013788~From wild pigs fed on small nuts retrieved by ranch hands nimbly climbing royal palms to all day vigils around wooden roasting boxes, getting pork right is a serious Cuban affair. This Lechón Asado falls in between those extremes. The pork shoulder is marinated in mojo then oven-roasted over several hours, usually overnight. The heat is cranked up at the very end until the skin turns a deep golden brown. Traditionally made for Nochebuena, it’s a holiday dish that’s simple enough to make for any occasion. This recipe comes from Sofía Benítez Otero.

According to Alan Davidson, in The Oxford Companion to Food, ""The name has nothing to do with Spain, any more than the counterpart term allemande has anything to do with Germany. It is generally believed that the terms were chosen because in French eyes Germans are blond and Spaniards are brown."""
5013831~Slice into this no-mixer-required, lemony cake and you’ll be greeted with a surprise: bold stripes of bright blueberry filling. The rich glaze adds an extra boost of sweet, lemon flavor.
5013832~At the restaurant Charlie Trotter bakes these small soufflés in thimble-shaped molds and sets them atop rounds of his own dried-fig brioche. Although he likes to use white Muscat grapes for the sauce, the recipe works well with any color or variety of grape. We used red seedless grapes, and they yielded a beautiful dark-pink sauce.
5013833~New England has a large Portuguese population. Their numbers are most concentrated in Massachusetts fishing centers, such as New Bedford, Glouchester and Providencetown, where they've had an important influence on the cuisine. One of their specialties is fried scallops, Portuguese-style--a sauté of bay scallops in butter with garlic and parsley. We've elaborated on the basic dish by adding shrimp, mushrooms, green onions and a white wine sauce. Serve it over rice, and offer buttered peas or broccoli on the side.

5013846~Offer this Italian cornmeal side dish in place of potatoes or rice. It's best served immediately out of the oven.
5013847~"Home turf: Ohio
Local flavor: Spaghetti topped with chili: It's as simple (and as bizarrely satisfying) as that. This combo has inspired some 200 chili parlors in the Cincinnati area. What sets it apart? It's thinner than your average chili and is packed with aromatic spices (allspice, cinnamon)—and a touch of chocolate. *Beef is the protein of choice, but we've gone with lamb here, which is amazing with the spice blend.
Make it a meal: garlic bread, salad with ranch dressing, and Samuel Adams black lager ($8 per six-pack)."
5013848~This side dish of silky mashed potatoes sweetened with pumpkin (left over from Pumpkin Muffins ), seasoned with fresh sage, and laced with melty strands of Fontina cheese is full of favorite autumnal flavors. But, surprisingly, it's the cider vinegar that really makes this dish sing—just a tablespoon of this stealth ingredient adds a roundness that ties the whole dish together. We love it with pork chops or turkey cutlets.
5015464~When preparing this menu, we suggest grilling the mango first, then the sofrito bread, and finally the salmon.
5016999~When buying the dried chile for this recipe, be aware that a pasilla de Oaxaca is not the same as a regular pasilla chile. The former is smoked and has a very distinct flavor.
5013851~"When I started working at Payard Pâtisserie in New York City, I had already been a pastry chef in Boston for a few years. I couldn't wait to see what this French guy could teach me. On my first day, I was handed a stack of recipes—all in French—and immediately realized it would be a challenging year. I spoke and read basic French, but I was pretty hazy on much of the baking vocabulary, and there were many words I'd never even seen before. Pithivier was one of them. I didn't even know how to pronounce it. (It's pee-tee-vee-YAY .) ""Watch and learn,"" Chef Payard told me. He sandwiched a mound of rum-scented almond cream between two large squares of homemade puff pastry and then quickly scalloped the edges of the pastry to look like a sunflower. Slash-slash-slash went his paring knife over the top pastry as he etched sun rays into the surface. The whole thing went into the oven and emerged golden brown with a glorious starburst pattern on top. It put every other pastry I had ever made previously to shame."

5013891~Chuckwagon cooks used to simmer beans for days, and the cowboys always thought they tasted best on the third day. This version, called frijoles de olla in Spanish, is even better reheated. The beans cook in flavorful juices that are also served with them.

5013924~Summer at the beach is unthinkable without coleslaw, but sometimes I hanker for something a bit out of the ordinary. I combined napa cabbage, a more delicate cousin to regular cabbage, with crunchy jicama, dressed it with white balsamic vinegar and mayo, and sprinkled on fennel seed to create what has become my new summer fave. This sturdy salad travels with ease, whether you're taking it to the beach or to a summer party with friends. Another plus: you can make it up to 24 hours in advance.
5013925~"""When it comes to cranberry sauce, I'm no fan of the back-of-the-bag recipe: It's too sweet and offers little in the way of texture.

Matcha is a type of green tea often used in the formal tea ceremony, but it is also used in a number of Japanese desserts. It doesn't give a strong tea flavour but creates a nice colour and slight dry tartness at the end of the palate. This cake is very light and refreshing compared to many New York- style cheesecakes.

5013935~Fig trees love warmer climates. However, for the adventurous northern gardener, the best way to grow figs is in a container that can be placed outdoors in warm weather and then brought indoors to winter. The best variety of fig tree for a container is the Petite Negri fig. It's a small- to medium-sized black fruit with sweet, red flesh. If you have great weather, Mission figs are superb. The natural sweetness of figs goes well with pork tenderloin in this dish. If you like, use sturdy fresh rosemary branches (as from the Tuscan variety) for the skewers.
5013936~This combination of slowly simmered carrots and onions is loaded with deep, full flavor that goes well with grilled meats.

5013939~"The technique: A single-crust pie requires only a bottom crust and is the best choice for a custard filling, like pumpkin pie.
The payoff: You have to make only one pie crust, and if it breaks or cracks it's easy enough to cobble the crust together in the pie dish. Most of the bottom crust will be covered with filling, so it doesn't have to look perfect."

5013941~This chiffon cake filled with rose-scented whipped cream is inspired by the aromatics found in Persian, Turkish, and Indian confections. Cardamom seeds have more flavor than the ground powder and are like little explosions of spice in the cake.

5013953~The first “real” recipe I ever tried was for the famous orange Julius. It was back in home-ec class and the no-fail recipe instantly became my favorite. Now I’m giving traditional orange Julius an upgrade by combining the vitamins C and A, potassium, fiber, and carotenoids found in sweet potatoes with tangy orange. This is a winning combination, light and refreshing with pops of citrus, yet dense and filling because of the sweet potato. Enjoy this as a meal or post-workout drink, or split it with a loved one for a snack! It’s ridiculously good.

5014037~"Beef brisket is the centerpiece of many Jewish holiday meals, particularly at Passover, and every family has their favorite way of preparing it. There are countless recipes out there, but how many do you need besides your grandmother's? At least one more: This one!
Why? Because the meat is slowly braised in Pinot Noir, and the cherry notes in the wine pair brilliantly with dried tart cherries, which plump up with winey beef juices to become little mini-pouches of flavor on their own. Add to that a bit of star anise, which perfumes the brisket and your home with an exotic and enticing hint of licorice. Season the mixture with the sweet-and-sour agrodolce dance of brown sugar and balsamic vinegar, and you have a brisket that is at once counterintuitively familiar and wonderfully different. Like all braised meats, brisket improves in flavor, and slices more easily, if made a day ahead and chilled (see Cooks' Notes)."

5014047~Pushing a buttery spice paste underneath the turkey's skin allows the flavor to perfume the meat—and gives it extra juiciness. Here, we use the favorite Indian combination of garlic and ginger paste, along with the technique of toasting spices and then grinding them, for the freshest, most powerful result. Though the paste may smell pungent, its flavor, once the turkey has been cooked, is quite gentle.

5014096~Highly recommended!
5014097~I like spreading Quark on my morning slice of bread and topping it with jam, but you can also mix it with salt and herbs and dollop it next to boiled potatoes for a light meal. Using buttermilk will result in skim Quark, which is best for baking recipes. If you want a creamier Quark to eat as is, simply stir a little heavy cream into the Quark to loosen and enrich it. (Mixed with high-quality fruit preserves, this makes for a luxurious little snack.)
5014098~The roast is cooked along with beef short ribs, ham hocks and sausage for a hearty meal. Offer with polenta, mashed potatoes or the Roasted Root Vegetables with Green Onions . Begin the veal the day before cooking to allow the garlic-herb rub to flavor the meat.
5014099~Highly recommended!
5014100~This frosty drink is as refreshing as frozen lemonade but has the added lushness of summer melon. Fresh thyme gives the fruits sweetness some grown-up dimension.
5014101~A slightly firm, mellow triple-crème, Mt. Tam cheese softens into this stew but doesn't melt. We like to add a little extra Sherry just before serving.

5014106~A simple but flavorful poultry main course.
5014107~"This beautiful side dish is perfect not only because it looks gorgeous but also because it's totally consumable! This creation was inspired by a dish I had in Puerto Rico, where I enjoyed a typical mofongo (mashed plantain dish) served in a pilón—which is a kind of mortar. I thought then, ""Wouldn't this be great in a tomato?"" Since then, I've been dreaming up all kinds of tomato stuffers! My first choice—as far as mushroom fillers—is domestic oyster, shiitake, or portobellos, which you can easily grill (or sauté!) ahead of time. Also, Manchego is another delicious option for the cheese."
5014108~If you have a food processor, you can make sausage from scratch. Adding pork fat to the meat gives these bite-size sausage patties a tender texture. Call your butcher in advance to make sure he sets aside some extra pork fat for you. To help the mixture blend more easily, be sure to freeze the pork pieces before grinding them in the processor. Keep in mind that the sausage needs to chill overnight so that the flavors have time to develop.
5014109~This tried and true recipe, a Hong Kong tradition of chicken roasted in the Chinese manner, has a long history in my family. It is the dish I have made when, because of circumstances, our family has not eaten together: my older son off to swimming practice, my daughter to ballet, and my younger son to lacrosse. Or I am off to a cooking class and I must leave dinner in the oven.

5014185~This may be my favorite accompaniment in the book. It's wonderful on pretty much everything, especially Buckwheat Crepes or Whole-Grain Buttermilk Pancakes, or stirred into The Very Best Oatmeal. Ricotta is traditionally made from the whey that's left over from the cheese-making process, and it's often extremely mild. This recipe brightens the simple cheese with a combination of honey, vanilla, and lemon zest¿transforming it into a light morning topping that could rival any high-end yogurt or jam.

5014246~"This recipe differs slightly from classic mojo in that it uses red onion instead of garlic. It's best to make this mojo a bit ahead of time so that the color of the red onion ""bleeds"" into the sour orange. The traditional accompaniment is grilled pork, but it's also wonderful with well-roasted chicken — charring its skin brings out the full flavors of the mojo."

5014252~Highly recommended!
5014253~Parsnips, carrots, leeks and baby potatoes complement the chicken in this appealing one-dish supper.

Uncork a distinctive Sauvignon Blanc.

5014256~My most coveted pie is of the apple variety. To me, nothing says an afternoon out by the grill than having an apple pie to finish off the experience. What sets this pie apart from your normal apple pie is that I use a whopping thirteen apples that I slowly cook down with Vietnamese cinnamon and brown sugar, creating a collection of flavors so distinctively comforting, you'll never search for another apple pie recipe. Use Maker's Mark bourbon as it is currently the only gluten-free bourbon available.
5014257~Multi-grain breads can vary widely in density. As a result, the 10 cups diced bread called for below may weigh a little more or less than 1 pound. We preferred a light-textured seven-grain bread for this stuffing.
5016139~This is the baked terrine I like to make for Sunday lunch, served with all the traditional trimmings of roast vegetables, steamed greens, and Yorkshire puddings . Leftovers can be reheated and served midweek with gravy, steamed green beans, and a generous spoonful of horseradish on the side.

5014262~Grilling is the name of the game for a vegetarian powerhouse stacked with meaty eggplant, melted Fontina cheese, and a luscious artichoke mayonnaise.
5014263~The Reuben sandwich and the Rosen family date back to when Alan's Grandpa Harry and his brother Mike ran the Enduro Sandwich Shoppes in the late 1920s in Manhattan. That began a long Rosen history of serving some of the best Reubens in New York—but not always with corned beef! Today you can walk into Junior's and still order the Original Reuben, made only with corned beef. But now you also have the option of a Turkey Reuben with melted Swiss and coleslaw, a Pastrami Reuben, and this one, the Combo Reuben, which is overstuffed with corned beef and pastrami. Feel free to make them any way you like. At Junior's each Reuben comes with grilled sauerkraut and melted Swiss and is always on rye bread, hot off the grill, with potato salad on the side.
5014264~The ultimate comforting supper, bursting with flavorsome vegetables and a rich herby gravy. You can either use some of the pre-frozen chicken filling , in which case thaw it, then assemble the pie and eat straight away. Alternatively, you can make the filling, let cool, and assemble the pie, then freeze the whole thing uncooked ready to defrost and bake in the oven at a later date.
5014265~Topping Napa cabbage and radishes with a distinctively tangy dressing results in a salad that's as lively as it is simple.
5014266~Fancy enough for company but easy enough for a weeknight, this complete Italian-inspired meal is cooked on two baking sheets, making cleanup a breeze.
5014267~To make this dish vegan, skip the crab.
5014268~Components of this salad can be prepared one day ahead, then tossed together at the last minute. Offer white wine spritzers and iced tea with lunch. Colorful ornamental kale can be found at some supermarkets and specialty foods stores.
5014269~At Thanksgiving, rice stuffings are standard on many southern tables. This one, a combination of white rice and wild rice, gets more regional notes from collard greens, pecans and ham.
5014270~Stew made with lamb may be known as the national dish, but beef is actually the most popular meat today. It turns up everywhere, including Tinakilly House in Rathnew, Ireland, where they offer this lovely dish. It's served with Champ (Green Onion Mashed Potatoes).
5014271~The sugar in the dry spice mix will help these steaks take on color quickly, so keep a close eye on them.
5014272~"This is my Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon salad. The two main ingredients—carrot and avocado—might not seem compatible or connected, but your first bite will convince you otherwise. The carrots are roasted with cumin and paired with orange, both classic pairings for the vegetable. The citrus goes great with cilantro, and both are a fine match for avocado. Before you know it, you have this fresh, vibrant salad. I love the carrots roasted to the same creamy softness of avocado. The contrast comes not from the texture but from the fact that one's warm from the oven and the other's cool from the fridge.
Sorry if I got your hopes up, but despite the salad's nickname, there's no bacon."
5016516~You'll have more spice rub than you need for the Grillades . Try this seasoning on fish, pork, or beef dishes.
5014274~Porcini and crimini mushrooms give this hearty soup its deep, almost meaty flavor. Cottage cheese holds the cheesy, parsley-flecked dumplings together.
5014275~This recipe originally accompanied Roast Beef, Basil, and Spicy Tomato Chutney Lavash Sandwiches.
5014276~Lime cordial is a mixture of sweet limeade syrup and beer, club soda, or seltzer, in a ratio of about 3 parts syrup to 1 part beer or soda (the syrup by itself can also be properly called lime cordial). The wonderfully refreshing drink both complements and tames intense spices.
5014277~Potatoes roasted with olive oil and chopped fresh rosemary are a nice accompaniment. What to drink: Poggio del Sasso.
5014278~If we had to give this salsa a heat index rating, it would get three out of five chiles.
5014279~Old-fashioned meat loaf gets a new lease on life in this recipe. Use the processor to chop leftover ham (or some purchased ham) for this flavorful loaf. Serve this with mashed potoates, corn bread, buttered peas, and a favorite beer or dry red wine.

5014307~A Chinese meal is incomplete without something leafy, and this dish features a wonderful green. The pleasant bite of gai lan, or Chinese broccoli, complements stir-fried shrimp beautifully; once you've tried it, you'll be eager to cook with it again.
5014308~Here, the building blocks of Scottish cranachan are brought together in a different guise, layered into an alternately crisp, creamy, and fruity cheesecake. It's not as rustically simple as the dessert that inspired it, but it does, I think, stay true to cranachan's ingredient-centric ethos, with honey, raspberries, whiskey, and oats in perfect balance.
5014309~Tender and succulent, this red wine-braised beef stew is the ultimate one-pot meal, loaded with tender potatoes and carrots. Don't forget to bring over a loaf of crusty French bread for sopping up the rich sauce.

5014311~Use a whipped-cream dispenser to portion the mousse à la minute, or double the ingredients and whip to stiff peaks in a bowl with an electric mixer.

5014327~This is a gem from my mother's notebook of Nonna Mary's recipes. I remember Nonna Mary serving these tomatoes along with assorted grilled meats during the summer in Cesenatico. They are also a perfect accompaniment to veal cutlets, and together they make a great sandwich, one of my favorite lunches that my mother would pack for me to take to school.

5014331~"Lane Crowther, Bon Appétit contributing editor, says, ""When I was young, the potatoes on the holiday table were always mashed. Even today, my mother, who is still in charge of our Thanksgiving dinners, will rarely stray from tradition. Either there has to be a trade-off to get her to try something new, or—as in the case of this recipe—innovation simply comes as an addition to the menu, not a replacement. Well, with so many different kinds of potatoes available nowadays, I like to mix varieties for their contrasting flavors, textures and colors. This combination of red potatoes and Yukon Gold is an easy-to-make and great-tasting accompaniment to any meal."""
5014332~Cooking anything very gently in oil produces a deliciously moist result (duck confit, for example), and this is no exception. The soft, tangled ribbons of carrot and fennel turn velvety and are balanced by slivers of lemon zest and the warm spark of cayenne.
5014333~Highly recommended!
5014334~The cumin really enhances this dish. Cook this spice with the onions to bring out its aroma. Lemon juice brightens the flavors while honey softens them.
5014335~An old-fashioned cake gets a new treatment: Some of the trimmed cake crumbs are mixed with chocolate-cookie crumbs and pressed onto the frosting. Fresh raspberries are the colorful crowning touch.

5014341~This is a satisfying vegetarian main course that takes full advantage of the flavor possibilities of garlic, here cooked until soft for sweetness and body, sautéed until golden for depth, and added raw for brightness.
5014342~In many sweet-potato pies, the ginger and spices overwhelm the flavor of the potatoes. This version plays to the flavor of the tubers; a little spicy nuttiness from the gingersnap pecan crust just emphasizes the pie's luscious creaminess. It is perfectly normal for the surface of a custardy pie, like this one, to crack in the course of baking and cooling—the pie will taste no less delicious.
5014343~The secret ingredient in this dish is a surprisingly modest one: grapefruit. Its tartness balances the unashamed, almost swaggering richness of scallops bathed in a butter sauce.
5014344~These delicate, lightly spiced cupcakes are reminiscent of carrot cake. Grated zucchini makes them exceptionally moist.

5014406~When you're making preserves, fully 50 percent of your success is in the shopping—good fruit makes good jam. Technique matters also, and a sound recipe makes a difference. But the crucial remaining factor is organization. Especially when dealing with a large quantity of perishable fruits or vegetables, you have to think through your strategy and plot out your work. If you can't get everything put up immediately, you have to take into account how the produce will ripen—and soon fade—as it waits for you.
5014407~Yes, you can buy just a turkey breast for this recipe. And when you cook it without the rest of the bird, you eliminate all those whole-bird problems. This goes great with Cornmeal Bao With Turkey and Black Pepper Sauce.

5014409~Tempered chocolate has a shiny, flawless appearance. It feels firm and breaks off with a snap when you bite into it and it melts smoothly in your mouth, allowing you to fully enjoy the flavor. Slowly heating and cooling melted chocolate while stirring puts it into temper. If chocolate is not tempered properly, the cocoa butter crystallization is uncontrolled and uneven, which results in an unattractive chocolate that is dull or has white streaks running through it. Untempered chocolate may feel rough or tacky and have a cakey, almost chewy texture. And it is more susceptible to heat and humidity, melting more easily and spoiling more quickly. Some simple candy recipes do not require tempered chocolate. However, candies such as truffles, dipped chocolates, and chocolate bars require tempering to achieve their signature appearance, taste, and texture.

5014425~When lacquered with a rich, complex sauce and roasted, chicken becomes a delicious crowd-pleaser. There's enough chipotle here to make your lips hum, but not so much as to overshadow the balancing act created by the other ingredients—toasty garlic, onions, and ketchup, plus a kiss of brown sugar and cinnamon.
5014426~The ultimate onion dip? You decide.
5014427~This is similar to the classic veal osso buco. Capocollo or pancetta (available at Italian delis) adds a nice smokiness. Serve this over noodles, mashed potatoes, or polenta.

You can make the soup a day in advance and it will taste even better the next day. This is a no-fail recipe that I know you're going to enjoy.
5014498~"Rice is a staple of Latin cuisines, and growing up in a Cuban family, I probably took it for granted. It was only when I left home that I realized how important well-cooked rice can be, both for the soul and other foods on the plate! I always try to impress on people that it's a sin to use converted or instant rice. It's got to be ""real"" rice, and preferably long-grain. Avoid flavoring rice, for that will detract from the flavors of the foods you're serving the rice with."
5014499~"This is the ""he-man"" of mojos, and the classic combination of lime, garlic, and oregano is a must for grilled red meats. Try it with flank steaks, T-bones, sirloin steaks, or lamb."
5014500~Broiling the tomatoes adds rich flavor to the sandwich.

5019065~Vanilla sugar keeps indefinitely and is wonderful sprinkled over French toast or on berries. It can also be used in place of sugar and vanilla extract when baking. You can add more sugar to the container and the bean will continue to infuse it.

5014513~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014514~The softly fried eggs are a wonderful counterbalance to the rich ingredients in this Spanish take on salade lyonnaise. Migas are Spanish croutons.
5014515~Blend and freeze four ingredients and, minutes later, you've got this creamy, frozen confection of plump, purple blueberries and cream. This egg-free version of ice cream demands the sweetest gems of summer for maximum flavor and color. Don't expect this to last too long. You'll be making your next batch before you know it. Rinse the berries just before using, no sooner.

5014521~Coarsely chopped coriander seeds add a lovely floral note to this nutty Middle Eastern grain.
5014522~It's hard to imagine anything better than freshly picked ears of corn roasting to golden-brown goodness on the grill. One taste of our Honey-Ginger Barbecue Sauce and you'll be wondering why you ever stuck to plain ol' butter. This sweet and tangy sauce transforms the season's staple produce into a standout, flame-kissed favorite.

5014524~Ground turkey is a fine substitute for the chicken.

5014526~Sliced or diced fresh avocado makes a colorful garnish for this hearty southwestern soup. If you want to cut up the avocado ahead of time but don't want it to discolor, simply place the avocado pieces in a colander and rinse them with cold water. They will stay bright green for about two hours.

5014532~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014533~This soup was inspired by a meal at the Copenhagen microbrewery Nørrebro Bryghus. (Who knew breweries could be fine-dining destinations?) Lager lends a malty richness to the velvety broth, thick with mussels; cold chopped avocado and tomato mingle with the heat, bringing the whole spectrum of flavors into sharper focus.
5014534~This chermoula sauce recipe is even better if it sits for a while to let the flavors meld.
5014535~Highly recommended!
5014536~A high proportion of butter makes for an extra-smooth and rich icing. For best results, use Philadelphia-brand cream cheese.

5014541~The secret to these macaroons' texture is the Italian meringue, composed of egg whites and a boiling sugar syrup. When baking these for Passover, dust the sheets with matzo cake meal; you can use flour at other times.
5019327~Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 30 min
5014543~Star anise's licorice-like flavor is what sets this ice cream apart. Our version is adapted from the one served at Geordy's restaurant in San Francisco, where the custard is made with all cream, no milk.

5014550~The young State of Israel has created many of its own customs. One is serving jelly doughnuts at Hanukkah, which are fried in oil to symbolize the miracle of the oil that lasted for eight days instead of one.
5014551~Don't worry about getting too much color on your pears—they will gain more caramel flavor the darker they go. This unusual dessert is a play on flavors—savory alongside sweet—and textures.
5014552~Highly recommended!
5014553~Splashes of lemon add a bright note to this simple chicken dish seasoned in the Provençal tradition with rosemary and garlic.
5014554~MAKING BREAKFAST SAUSAGE is an old family tradition for us. My grandpa's family used to raise their own hogs, and when it came time for butchering day, they made sure that nothing went to waste. All parts of the animal were used—for hams, bacon, lard, and sausage. My grandpa was in charge of making the breakfast sausage—a tradition he passed on to us.
5014555~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014556~This paste showcases the layered flavors typical of Southeast Asian cooking. While the lemongrass does require a bit of work, its subtle but penetrating flavor is key. Adjust the amount of jalapeño peppers according to your heat tolerance and the heat level of the chiles you are using. We also like to use this spice paste on any type of grilled lamb.
5014557~The vegetables, along with the canned Italian tuna, in this colorful tossed salad create a positively satisfying meal. (Using an imported brand of tuna will make all the difference.)
5014558~Mint gives delicious lift to the coconut flavors in this cake, which gets moistness from sweetened condensed milk and coconut cream.
5014559~Adding fleur de sel at the end transforms this tart into a delicious cross between a cheese course and dessert.
5014560~Two warnings about these cookies: Don’t give them to young children before bedtime and don’t leave them lying around, if you want any left for yourself. These cookies are crisp on the edges and have a chewy middle strewn with pockets of soft chocolate. The espresso powder, as Kelsey (The Naptime Chef) noted, amplifies the chocolate, but not the sweetness, making it a grown-up cookie. When making any cookies, make sure to cream the butter really well—this aerates the cookies and integrates the sugar—but be conservative with your mixing once the dry ingredients are added.
5014561~Dill and arugula complement this lovely salad.
5014562~Highly recommended!
5014563~Highly recommended!
5014564~We love this marinade on Kalbi . Try it for an Asian twist.
5014565~This is a perfect autumn salad: not so much cooked as wilted greens in a warm, savory-sweet vinaigrette. Here in the South, we are lucky to have so many different greens that grow remarkably well virtually all year round. From the traditional collards, spinach, mustard, and turnip greens to the international varieties that have recently made their way here, including bok choy, tatsoi, and komatsuna, there are a variety of tastes and textures to choose from. No matter where you live, experiment with seasonal greens until you find your favorites. If you're shopping at the farmers' market, most of the vendors will be happy to let you have a few nibbles for taste-testing. The same goes for the squash—you can use butternut, acorn, pumpkin, African, or any similar variety. At Summerland Farm, we are lucky to have American chestnut trees planted by my ancestors, and even luckier that those trees survived the chestnut blight that killed most American chestnuts in the first half of the twentieth century. Fresh chestnuts—often grown in California—are available in many natural foods stores in the cooler months. If you can't find chestnuts, hazelnuts or cashews would make a good substitute.
5014566~Thanksgiving on a roll
5014567~This recipe has subtle Asian flavors that delicately perfume the turkey in a way thats beautifully compatible with the rest of the Thanksgiving meal.

5014569~Peaches are amazing for your skin. They provide vitamin A, which helps prevent clogged pores, so your complexion stays clear and healthy.
5014570~The simple, delicious and versatile ginger sauce would also be terrific with shrimp. Look for rice vinegar in the Asian foods section of the supermarket. Serve the scallops with crusty bread or rice.

5014579~"The French often serve flavored wine as an aperitif. This one has a base of red wine infused with orange, lemon, vanilla and cloves; it is later mixed with raspberry brandy and sugar. The drink is best at cool room temperature, accompanied by nibbles such as olives, almonds and crudités. It also makes an excellent Christmas present  — just double or triple the recipe, and pour the drink into pretty bottles. Be sure to begin the ""winemaking"" process at least three weeks before you plan to have the wine or give it as a gift."
5014580~This is a true weekend-long project—and that's a good thing. Seasoning, cooking, and crisping the meat over the course of three days mean you don't have to spend hours in the kitchen the day you're hosting a big meal. In fact, the extra time your pork spends in the refrigerator only improves the taste. This is the perfect-for-a-party pork that gives you plenty of time to drink a beer and watch (or play) a game or two before grilling up crispy, tender slabs of pork shoulder for a crowd.
5014581~Fresh and creamy all at once, this clever combination of rich ricotta ice cream and icy-cold watermelon chunks is a twist on the classic Creamsicle. Shaved bittersweet chocolate complements both flavors beautifully.

5014591~Skip a step when making mac and cheese by not precooking the pasta. Instead, mix the dried pasta with a thinner-than-usual béchamel sauce, and it will bake perfectly in just 30 minutes.
5014592~We took the feta cheese out of this classic dish and stirred it into the rice that accompanies it, for a yummy variation. A cucumber salad is the perfect partner. Buy your favorite cookies for dessert.
5014593~Highly recommended!
5014594~This is really a base for other soups that can also be served on it's own — but consider adding some jalapeño pepper, cilantro, and lime juice; or diced tomato, chopped parsley, matchsticks of zucchini, and thinly sliced basil; cooked peas and small leaves of spinach; lemongrass, curry leaves, and lime juice; or any other seasoning group that seems enjoyable.
5014595~A refreshing herbal iced tea with a nice crimson color. For a frosted look, freeze the glasses ahead of time, and dip the rims into sugar before pouring the tea.
5014596~Though this recipe owes a debt to that icon of childhood desserts, Jell-O with whipped cream, the interplay of floral passion fruit and herbal basil is nothing if not elegant.
5014597~This mild wild fish replete with omega-3 fatty acids combines the tastes of trout and salmon; it is available in the winter when wild salmon is still a month away. Slow-roasting a fish high in fat keeps it moist and flavorful.
5014598~"This stock is even easier to put together than <epi:recipelink id=""105266"">Strong Fish Stockepi:recipelink. It does not require fish heads, only the bones of flat fish — sole, founder, halibut, or turbot — and it doesn’t call for the extra step of sweating the bones. It has a more delicate seafood flavor, and it is not as gelatinous as the Strong Fish Stock, making it very versatile. In addition to chowder and seafood stews like bouillabaisse, you can use this to make fish velouté and delicate French sauces such as Bercy (based on velouté and shallots) or bonnefemme.</epi:recipelink></epi:recipelink>"
5014599~Highly recommended!
5014600~Ask your butcher for the chateaubriand (the thicker end) of the fillet, and have him trim it for you. Rub the salt mixture on the beef at least one day and up to three days ahead. Steamed or roasted asparagus spears are the perfect accompaniment to this elegant meal.
5014601~Highly recommended!

5014605~"""While vacationing in northeastern Minnesota, I had dinner at the Cove Point Lodge in Beaver Bay. The highlight of my meal there was called Lucca pasta, a blend of fettuccine, chicken and vegetables in a creamy, slightly spicy sauce,"" says Debra Adam of St. Paul, Minnesota."
5014606~Potatoes lend moistness, and caraway seeds and onions--two ingredients favored by German, Scandinavian and Eastern European immigrants--add flavor to these traditionally shaped rolls.
5014607~Cranberries might seem out of place in a salsa, but their zesty crunch anchors this mix of roasted pineapple, onion, and cilantro. Besides, what would Thanksgiving be without cranberries?
5014608~Try this sweet alternative to fat-and cholesterol-laden crème brûlée.
5014609~Highly recommended!
5014610~(Marillenglasur)
5014611~Cooking the shrimp with their shells on helps them retain flavor; scoring them along the back lets you remove the vein and makes peeling easier. Win-win.

5014623~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014624~Like the cake layers, the frosting is made in two separate batches; each batch yields about eight cups.
5014625~Small whole fish like trout, char, walleye, bass, and even lake perch are excellent for planking, especially smoke-planking. They get the flavor of the wood plank on one side and a burnished golden color and smoky flavor on the other. An indirect fire is used to slowly cook the whole fish through. Char, in flavor and texture a cross between trout and salmon, is best planked whole. It's easier to fillet after it is cooked and stays moister that way. This method can be used with fish fillets and steaks, too. Whenever you grill fish, grill lemon halves alongside. The little bit of browning adds flavor, and the heat makes the lemons burst with juice.
5014626~Adapted from The Daily Scoop, Barrington, RI
5014627~Cornmeal and fresh corn are used in the creamy polenta. A green onion Dijon mixture is spread under the skin of the chicken before it's grilled.
5014628~Ice cream at its easiest: crystallized ginger is mixed into softened vanilla ice cream.

5014636~In this Filipino dish, achiote oil bathes the shrimp in an amber hue, and citrus lends a bright, tart note.
5014637~Steaming the carrots tenderizes them before baking. The honey really heats up; during baking, check once or twice so it doesn't burn the carrots.

5014668~One of our most popular appetizers, bluefish pâté has been on the menu for many years. We serve it with Kalamata olives and commercial pickled cipollinis (bulbs of grape hyacinths that taste like pickled onions). Pickled onions are a fine substitute.
5014669~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014670~When cooking shrimp in boiling water, 2 minutes does the job. Overcooking toughens them.
5014671~Beneath a humble, oaty streusel topping lies a sleek, inky jumble of plums and blackberries—talk about a delicious contrast. A combination of cornstarch and tapioca in the filling helps to keep the colors of the fruit true and to set up their juices nicely without becoming too thick.
5014672~Buttery, flaky, quick—this dough has it all. See cooks' note, if you need to halve the recipe to make the plum-blackberry streusel pie .
5014673~This addictive appetizer is a delicious combination of sour cream, cheese, and corn. A little minced jalapeño adds heat.

5014679~Highly recommended!
5014680~Omani lemons (also called Persian dried limes) give a sour, slightly musty, and very authentic taste to this stew. They intensify the saffron, so if you want to scale back a bit on that flavor, omit them and add extra Key lime or lemon juice at the end.
5014681~A marinade of balsamic vinegar, olive oil, honey, herbs and spices perks up the grilled chicken and vegetables in this dish. It's all served with wild rice.
5014682~We get a little weak-kneed with delight around cakes, particularly cakes whimsically shaped to look like something else—in this case, a Yule log. Made famous in France as Bûches de Noël, these sheet cakes, filled, rolled, and frosted to look like the trunks of trees, complete with the stumps of sawed off branches, provide creative cooks the very real opportunity to play with their food. Want a few woodsy meringue mushrooms made from meringue to continue the conceit? Why not?

5014798~I get a lot of inspiration from staring at the supermarket shelves, and seeing what items are grouped together. I made this recipe because I found the smoked oysters next to the anchovies in the canned fish section and decided to try them out instead in my Caesar dressing. Once I did that, I decided to riff on the croutons a bit too. In this recipe, the smoky oysters complement the rich egg yolks, which in turn get cut by a healthy dose of lemon juice. Do you like other canned fishies? All are good Caesar salad material, providing they are packed in oil, which amps up their flavor almost to a condiment level of oomph. If you want to get real crazy, find the canned seafood section in an ethnic market.

5014828~Daniel Boulud always had a preference for classic French desserts, so I developed this recipe for the lunch menu when I was pastry chef at Daniel. The dessert itself is very simple: We bake an undocked, thick round of puff pastry, letting it puff up high, and serve it hot, filled with Orange-Scented Pastry Cream and topped with a buttery caramel sauce and a few Candied Pecans. The puff pastry rounds should be baked à la minute, never ahead of time, though the dough can be rolled out and cut in advance, and stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to a day. Sometimes the best desserts are the simplest.

But unlike the glass versions, which were quite expensive, the ones we used to play with were made of clay and colored in various bright, glossy shades. They were fragile, and their glaze would crack, revealing their dark red insides, similar in color to these delicious meatballs with bulgur.

5014846~Whether you call them magic bars or seven-layer (or sometimes five-layer) cookies, you probably know these treats. Chunky bits—like chocolate chips, nuts, and coconut—get layered over sticky condensed milk and a crisp cookie crust. The bars are perfect for potlucks because they're portable and super-easy to make. The problem is (for me!) that they're always way too sweet. In this version, you'll find a potato-chip crust, unsweetened coconut flakes, and salted smoked almonds. The bars are just as chewy, crunchy, and appealing as the usual but taste less sugary.

5014853~Slathering mustard on chicken is one easy way to a juicy, flavorful bird. Like its creator, Ruth Cousineau, this dish revels in simplicity without being austere: Gild the lily by making a delectably creamy, mustardy gravy from the pan juices. The gravy, in turn, begs for mashed potatoes, and by adding a salad—voilà, the perfect Sunday dinner. (Editor's note: This recipe is solely the creation of Ruth Cousineau and has not been formally tested by the test kitchen.)

You could also serve them at room temperature, though they won't be quite as crispy on the outside and creamy in the center.

5014872~This colorful one-pot main dish meshes savory mussels with Asian aromatics for a contemporary take on moules marinière. Bottled fresh carrot juice is a flavorful (and not-to-be-sniffed-at) shortcut.
5014873~This slightly unusual side dish takes the place of your standard green beans, lending a light and crunchy contrast to the heavier, puréed dishes in this menu. (Most people don't think of cooking jicama, but we love its crisp water-chestnut-like texture, raw or sautéed.)

5014880~Eggplant can take its time getting tender in the oven, but it's worth it, especially for preparations like this, where za'atar, with its earthy flavor, and sweet-tart pomegranate molasses turn things toward the Middle East.

5014905~South Indian rice is parboiled during processing, which creates a more nutritious but harder grain that needs to be boiled like pasta for 40 minutes. The grains are puffy and separate, and they absorb the curries beautifully. Indian parboiled rice can be ordered from iShopIndian.com; but if this type is not available, American-style converted rice or regular long-grain white rice are both good substitutes.

5014919~The homey and hearty dishes of Louis Szathmáry—a splendidly mustached man who was the chef-owner of Chicago's well-known Hungarian restaurant The Bakery—are the inspiration for this dinner. Of course, chef Louis cooked using lots of butter and cream, but with just a touch of fat we've retained many of the same earthy flavors that he loved.

5014925~"When I was in Trinidad, Winnie Lee Lum showed me how to make this superb dish, which beautifully demonstrates the convergence of Chinese and Trinidadian cooking traditions. Of course, the taste was extraordinary because Lee Lum only cooks with fresh local shrimp that her husband, Tony, purchases for her. Before cooking, she rinses the shrimp in lime juice, a Trinidadian cooking practice said to remove the ""fishy"" taste. She prefers the Chinese custom of cooking the shrimp in the shell to protect the shrimp's succulence and flavor. Rather than rice wine, Lee Lum insists on using dark Jamaican-style rum; according to her, white rum is too harsh for cooking. This is one of the easiest dishes to stir-fry, and it is guaranteed to satisfy."

5014943~Saturday dinner. From Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah. Give lean pork tenderloin a rubdown with executive chef Jim Gallivan's potent adobo chile mix. The spicy bean salsa topper adds fiber but not a lick of fat.

5014945~Turkey may not have played as big a part in the first Thanksgiving, held back in 1621, as it does in our contemporary celebration. If turkey was served at all, it was probably one of many game birds, that were served along with venison, oysters, clams, lobsters, and eels, as well as succotash, beach plums, sweet potatoes, leeks and cornbread. My own Thanksgiving menu is intended to pay homage to the foods of the first Thanksgiving , as well as to the foods that have become associated with this holiday. I believe that holidays by their own nature demand that traditional foods be served. In America, there is no stronger correlation between the food and the day than that of the venerable Thanksgiving Day turkey.

5014948~Throw everything in the pan, and voilà! Cranberry sauce. Its just five ingredients simmering on the stove, but it tastes beguilingly complex. Tangerine juice and zest, fresh ginger, and plump golden raisins add a citrusy, spicy sweetness to tart, bursting cranberries.

5017577~If you choose to bake only one cookie from this collection, make it these bites. The crisp cookie base provides the perfect contrasting setup to the luscious caramel-flavored dulce de leche—caramelized milk—hidden under the creamiest cheesecake layer. The final snazzy drizzle of dulce de leche is not essential, we know, but it makes the bites downright irresistible.
5014955~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5014956~There are two schools of thought when it comes to matzo brei: the softer scrambled eggs style and the firmer frittata style. My family prefers the latter, and we usually think of matzo brei as a Passover version of French toast, eating it with maple syrup and a sprinkle of salt for breakfast or a light supper. But sometimes I turn this humble dish into an elegant savory main course that incorporates the delicate young green garlic and leeks sold at farmers’ markets this time of year. Topped with silky smoked salmon and horseradish-spiked crème fraîche, this matzo brei is too beautiful to serve only during the eight days of Passover.
5014957~Almost any berry, or combination of berries, can be substituted in this recipe.
5014958~For a particularly light and crunchy coating we used panko (coarse Japanese bread crumbs) on these crab cakes rather than regular bread crumbs. Panko is increasingly available in this country, not only in Asian markets but also in seafood shops.

5014964~For anyone born in the Bluegrass State, the mint julep has a special significance: It's traditionally served on Kentucky Derby Day, the first Saturday in May. But it makes a great cocktail for any warm-weather afternoon. We've added a splash of club soda to make the drink a little lighter and more refreshing.

5014972~This very typical Lao dish may also be made with fish, pork, beef, or, in Southeast Asian tradition, water buffalo meat. While laap is often made with raw meat or fish, our chicken-based rendition is stir-fried, as it was when Lao cooks served it to us. A powder made from toasted glutinous rice subtly flavors the dish.
5014973~"Carey Paquette of Arlington, Virginia, writes: ""My boyfriend and I cook almost every night as a way to unwind. It's nice to come home after a hectic day and make dinner together rather than pull something prepackaged out of the freezer. One of our favorite things is grilled vegetables. I'm always adding them to meals, since they don't need a lot of preparation. They're the key ingredients in my popular chicken sandwiches."""

5014980~I originally designed this recipe for wild snow geese, and because many of California's snow geese spend their summers on Wrangel Island, near Siberia, it seemed fitting to give the stew a Russian feel. But of course the legs of any goose or duck, wild or domesticated, will work here.
5014981~Our Cuban-style mango mojo could enhance any grilled meat, as could the anise-seed rub. Adding our grilled asparagus and herbed bulgur creates a well-rounded meal, but rice and green beans or broccoli would also work.

I would love to have the recipe for chef Stephen Gontram's wonderful chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and herb-roasted tomatoes."""
5015011~Spain's famous piquillo peppers add a sweet-spicy edge to the aioli. Idiazábal, a smoky sheep's-milk cheese from the Basque region, is great with the portobellos. If you can't find Idiazábal, substitute smoked Gouda.
5015012~Serve with the Double-baked Potatoes and steamed broccoli. What to drink: Cabernet Sauvignon. Have angel food cake with sliced strawberries for dessert.
5015013~A popular taco filling in Mexico, pork al pastor is usually cooked in a huge slab on a vertical rotisserie (like Middle Eastern shawarma) and sliced off to order, so that the outside bits are crisp and golden and the inside is juicy and tender. Cooks often stick an onion or a pineapple on top of the rotisserie so that its juices drip down over the well-seasoned meat. Pineapple takes a more central role in this grilled version: The puréed fruit sweetens the basting sauce, while chunks of it join the pork and onion on the skewers. A homemade salsa and an array of accompaniments invite guests to get in on the action.

5015034~"Neal Fraser, Executive Chef and co-owner of Grace and BLD in Los Angeles, shared this recipe with Epicurious. The dish is perfect for entertaining, since the endive and celery root flans can be made ahead and reheated. The garlic nage should be made shortly before serving and kept warm while you quickly sear the turbot. A shaving of earthy black truffles finishes the dish. ""Grating them on top makes them soft and allows their perfume to stand out,"" says Fraser."

If you can't find fava beans, use limas. Start this recipe the night before to soak the chickpeas, kidneys beans, and fava beans. Boil them in a pot with four cups of water for one minute, then turn off the heat and add a splash of apple cider vinegar. Cover the pot and let them soak overnight

5015135~Miso, a salty, earthy Japanese bean paste, is rich in vitamin B and protein. White miso, also known as shiro miso, has a more delicate flavor than darker miso pastes.

5015158~This recipe offers a prime example of cooking à la minute because the entire dish can be prepared and executed very quickly. (It also uses few enough ingredients that you could purchase all of them in the express lane of your local supermarket on the way home from work.) After sautéeing the halibut, the fish is removed from the pan, which is then deglazed with white wine and fresh lemon juice. Butter is swirled in gradually to yield a rich, flavorful sauce — punctuated by scallions, capers, and diced tomato — that is simply poured over the fish; its pleasing citric acidity and buttery richness make it a perfect foil for the halibut.
5015159~"Light, creamy, warm, and slightly-sweet egg-based dressing is the perfect companion to zesty watercress. This is adapted from a recipe in ""Valentine Dinner for Two"" from the February 1977 issue of Glamour magazine, which we updated for our 2016 Epi Valentine's Menu."

5015172~Juicy pineapple meets creamy avocado, crisp jicama, and red onion in a refreshing salad that goes especially well with the cilantro-chipotle tilapia .
5015173~Highly recommended!
5015174~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015175~"The leftover Savoy cabbage from our <epi:recipelink id=""351167"""">Winter Minestrone</epi:recipelink> makes a quick and easy side dish when thinly sliced and sautéed with some scallions and garlic. It tastes great with pork chops, chicken, or fish."
5015176~I just love cooking these little snacks as a starter. I like to think of them as the grown-up version of potato wedges with sweet chile and sour cream. Whoever came up with that combination deserves a medal. These cakes work well with shrimp, crayfish and even roast chicken but I especially like them with crabmeat. Enjoy!
5015177~Highly recommended!
5015178~The following dish was a popular choice for bridge luncheons in the 1960s.
5015179~With its warm, comforting flavors of sausage, olives, and white wine, this rustic dish will transport your guests to a farmhouse in Umbria.
5015180~Make this salad as tart or as creamy as you like with the addition of more vinegar or mayonnaise.
5015181~Rolling out and shaping this handmade pasta together is the fun part. Make the dough a day ahead, wrap in plastic, and keep chilled.
5015182~The bacon and sautéed nuts play well against the greens. If you like your food a bit tart, add a splash of Sherry vinegar.
5015183~It's all about the contrast in flavors, textures, and colors in this hearty winter side featuring naturally sweet pan-roasted carrots, refreshing oranges, and pleasantly bitter radicchio.
5015184~Italians are crazy for dark leafy greens of all kinds, and Swiss chard is a particular favorite in the fall. Here, with stems and ribs included, you get the full earthy spectrum of the vegetable.
5015185~"Pavlova is Australian for ""big meringue topped with stuff"" (typically berries and whipped cream)."
5015186~Highly recommended!
5015187~Highly recommended!
5015188~Using orange juice instead of water in the crust enhances the fruit flavors in the filling. To prevent the dough from sticking, lightly flour the work surface and the dough, sprinkling with more flour as needed; also, roll just to the edges of the dough, not over them, rotating the dough often.
5015189~The sweet, sour and spice combination, is common all over the Mediterranean and is often found in Catalan cuisine, especially with poultry and game birds. Serve this impressive main course with crisp roasted potatoes and a dry white Penedès wine.
5015190~Sweet and sour are two of the five flavors of classical Chinese cooking (along with salty, pungent, and bitter), and go lo yuk, as the dish is called, is a favorite way to prepare pork in Cantonese cooking. The recipe here has a lighter sauce more akin to the Cantonese version than the overly sweet goopiness of bad takeout versions, but it also has the crispy boneless pork that any lover of this dish will recognize. I prefer fresh pineapple, but if you like your dish sweeter, use canned pineapple and reserve some of the juice from the can to add to the sauce in place of fresh pineapple juice.
5015191~Reflecting the cuisines of Israel and the surrounding Mediterranean Middle Eastern countries, this meatless stew is seasoned with mint and lemon. Serve it with sesame seed rolls and a tomato and cucumber salad; have pistachio ice cream for dessert.
5015192~"""For maximum flavor, I like to toast the nuts until they're almost burnt."""
5015193~It's hard not to love this classic Italian pasta—it's just the right mix of spicy and sweet.
5015194~Highly recommended!
5015195~Highly recommended!
5015196~Preserved lemons, sold ready-made in Moroccan souks, are essential to that country's cuisine. The peel, pulp, and juice squeezed from the lemons can all be used. Sometimes, however, the juice and preserving brine, can be bitter; use fresh lemon juice in that case.
5015197~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015198~Often called kosher-style dill pickles, these are quick to make. Use either small whole cucumbers or cut larger ones into quarters. For an additional interesting flavor, tuck a small dried hot red pepper into each jar.
5015199~Highly recommended!
5015200~At the ranch, Lisa Ahier makes this salsa with and without avocado. At Gourmet, we liked it with.
5015201~The chicken sausages are a terrific time-saving ingredient: They're already cooked and full of flavor.
5015202~Inoue loves to use this marinade on any cut of beef (hanger is another favorite), chicken wings, or pork ribs.
5015203~Kohlrabi has a muted flavor and crunchy texture similar to a broccoli stem, which is something to keep in mind for this pickles recipe.
5015204~This recipe was created to accompany Onion and Bell Pepper Strata with Fresh Tomato Salsa . Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015205~You can substitute wasabi powder for the wasabi paste in this recipe, but we find that the paste imparts a fresher flavor. Force the wasabi powder through a very fine sieve before using.
5015206~In Cuba, this dish is traditionally served on New Year's Day. In this tradition, as in the Hawaiian luau, the pig is usually covered with banana leaves and cooked over a coal fire in a pit that's dug in the backyard. Because this method is not easy to do at home, the recipe below uses a small suckling pig that will fit in the oven, yet deliver the same delicious flavor. Ask your butcher to split the pig for you. Don't be afraid to give this recipe a try — cooking a whole small pig is like cooking a whole turkey.
5017247~Spectacular but easy, thanks to purchased ice cream and sorbet. The meringue is browned in the broiler, like a baked Alaska, just before serving.

5015216~This recipe originally accompanied Roast Turkey with Bourbon Glaze .
5015217~Lightly blanched squid makes a simple and elegant salad with the tang of fish sauce and fresh lime juice.
5015218~This bread and butter pudding gets its Italian flavor from panettone, a Milanese egg bread studded with raisins and candied fruit. Long a Christmastime specialty, panettone is becoming increasingly available throughout the year not only in Italy but also in the United States.
5015219~Steaming is back! The vinegar-and-spice-infused liquid flavors the beets as they cook.
5015220~Bisquick got its start in the early thirties when Carl Smith, a salesman for General Mills, took a late-night train ride. He went to the dining car in hopes of finding something to eat, and was pleasantly surprised to be served freshly made biscuits. When he asked about them, the chef confessed that he kept a pre-mixed batch of ingredients for the dough in the freezer for late orders. Smith reported back to General Mills, suggesting that they market such a mix, and they did. But it’s not just for biscuits; Bisquick can be used to make pancakes and waffles, and this luscious coffee cake, too.
5018587~Highly recommended!
5020092~Saffron threads and fresh garlic add a kick of color and flavor to this creamy mayo that's perfect for dipping or spreading.
5015223~The flavors of apples dipped in peanut butter, all cozied up inside a flaky puff pastry crust. Sold!
5015224~Highly recommended!
5015225~I love crunchy fennel and peppery arugula dressed with a slightly sweet dressing made from Meyer lemons—a fresh-tasting pick-me-up. Meyer lemons are only available in the wintertime, so if you can’t find them, use regular lemon juice and replace a third of it with fresh orange juice.
5015226~This sweet and refreshing drink features layers of chocolatey coffee slushie, vanilla whipped cream, and coffee jelly (think coffee jell-o).
5015227~"Because the lamb in this recipe is marinated in a barbecue-style sauce and then grilled, the hotel nicknamed the dish ""paniolo"", which means ""cowboy"" in hawaiian."
5015228~Highly recommended!
5015229~Highly recommended!
5015230~Here's a great new way to roast beets: in a salt crust. The horseradish, thyme, and orange in the crust infuse the beets with bright flavor as they're cooking. Leftover beets make a great addition to salads. Lightly coat torn butter lettuce with a Sherry wine vinaigrette, top with the sliced beets and some sliced red onion, and drizzle with a bit of the horseradish crème fraîche.
5015231~Highly recommended!
5015232~Have some roasted potatoes and broccoli on the side, then finish with decadent slices of chocolate layer cake.
5015233~You could hardly do better in summer than to combine shellfish and tomatoes—their balance of sweet and savory seems to bring out the best in both. Here, the seafood retains its succulence, while its juices combine with the vinaigrette; you'll want to sop up the excess with bread, or at least eat it with a spoon.
5015234~Butter beans are among the late-summer treasures in Charleston. For this simple, satisfying side, use the small green kind (or frozen baby lima beans in the off-season).
5015788~Highly recommended!
5015236~Use the ripest, juiciest blackberries or raspberries for this cocktail.
5015237~Roast or grill ramps (technically a wild leek) to bring out their fragrant garlic notes.
5015238~Add a salad and lemon meringue pie.
5015239~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015240~It's worth the extra effort to make this rich stock; the slow-simmered taste produces a sauce that far exceeds any made with canned beef broth.
5015241~We like serving these chewy, moist almond cakes, which are based on the financier, a French pastry, in individual gratin dishes, but the batter can also be baked in a 9-inch glass pie plate for 30 to 35 minutes.
5015242~Highly recommended!
5015243~Dried cherries are simmered in Banyuls vinegar and brown sugar, creating a sweet-sour sauce.
5015244~Highly recommended!
5015245~Hazelnuts and wild mushrooms - popular ingredients from Oregon and Washington - add terrific flavor and texture to this sophisticated stuffing.
5015246~Think of plantains as the sister to the banana. They’re not as sweet, as they contain less sugar. They’re also higher in starch than most fruits, making them perfect for gluten-and grain-free breads. My favorite part of this entire dish is upon serving: The moment you break the egg white just enough for the golden yolk to spill over, the starchy flatbread soaks up every last bit, leaving you with a nice balance of moisture. The egg yolk is rich and bold, with the added bonus of sprinkled salt and drizzled honey—there’s nothing like it.
5015247~The Middle East on a flatbread: Turkish meatballs, a tahini-spiked yogurt sauce, and muhammara, a Syrian red pepper spread.

5015249~Highly recommended!
5015250~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015251~If you haven't thought of duck as comfort food before, this will change your mind. Pasta, confit duck, and Savoy cabbage become the perfect cool-weather dinner—rich and succulent without seeming heavy. If you haven't had confit duck before, trust us: It's just as good as you would imagine duck cooked in rendered fat would be.
5015252~"We are happy to announce that Bev Jones has won our November ""Cook the Cover"" contest with her delicious variation on our Miso-Rubbed Turkey with Turkey Gravy."
5015253~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015254~These can be prepared one week ahead.
5015255~Steam, fluff; steam, fluff. This couscous recipe is time-consuming but worth it.
5015256~A nice dish for a brunch buffet.
5015257~This recipe is an accompaniment for Pear Charlottes with Chamomile Crème Anglaise .
5015258~Purchased sorbet, frozen yogurt and pound cake make this the season's quickest elegant dessert.
5015259~Perfect with a cup of tea, especially a nicely spiced Indian chai.
5015260~This creamy mixture of spinach, cheese and basil is an unforgettable side dish.
5015261~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less, but requires additional unattended time.
5015262~Highly recommended!
5015263~Don’t feel like making your own maraschino cherries? Luxardo brand, made with Marasca sour cherries, is our jarred go-to. (Skip those gross neon-red ones.)
5015264~This recipe is an accompaniment for Peach Baked Alaskas with Spiced Peaches and Raspberries.
5015265~This festive main offers something for everyone—baby back ribs, chicken breasts, and smoked sausages. Be sure to start the dish a few hours ahead. The ribs are slow-cooked for an hour and a half, then are finished on the grill with the chicken and the sausages.
5015266~"Kathy Johnson of New Orleans, Louisiana, writes: ""Having lived in one of America's major food cities most of my life, I am no stranger to good eating. As much as my husband, Paul, and I love dining out, we particularly like making meals together at home. Some of our greatest hits have been the easiest and quickest dishes. It seems that the more I cook, the more I realize that big flavor comes not from the time spent in the kitchen, but from the quality of the ingredients."""
5015267~"Jeanne Thiel Kelley, a contributing editor at Bon Appétit, says, ""As far back as I can remember, my father has been glazing the holiday ham with Marsala (we always have ham and turkey on Thanksgiving). When I started making the cranberry sauce, I decided to mix in a little Marsala, figuring that the combination would complement the ham nicely. I was right, and the sauce is terrific with turkey, too. Rosemary might seem like an unusual seasoning in this sauce, but for me it's a natural addition. I live in Southern California, and fresh rosemary is just everywhere."""
5015268~Highly recommended!
5015269~Pork shoulder bacon may not get quite as crisp as belly bacon, but it has a great taste and a meaty texture. Even if you have a thermometer for your grill, you'll still need an instant-read — the grill thermometer won't register low enough to monitor the cold-smoking.
5015270~Highly recommended!

5015272~Crisp anise cookies are layered with raspberries and honey-flavored cream. There are enough cookies to make four desserts, with extras for nibbling.

5015274~A luscious tropical treat enhanced with a delicious crust made of gingersnap cookies and macadamia nuts. Begin preparing this one day before you plan to serve it.
5017093~This is one of my everyday vinaigrettes. The wood aging of the sherry vinegar creates a wonderfully complex flavor that is enhanced by the walnut oil. Sherry vinegar is a little more expensive than red wine vinegar, but it has a higher acidity so you use less. Pair this dressing with strongly flavored salad greens, cheeses, nuts, and seasonal fruits, like in my Seasonal Country Salad.
5015276~Made with less water than is used for soft polenta, the firm polenta in this appetizer has a texture like that of dough. Make sure the work surface, rolling pin and cookie cutter are wet — otherwise, the polenta will stick.
5015277~Frozen cherries are the star in a vibrant, herby pan sauce that is made while the lightly spiced pork tenderloin rests.
5015278~Using a mandoline to slice the carrots turns them into ribbons, and cooking them briefly keeps them from being too crunchy. If you don't have a mandoline, use a vegetable peeler.
5015279~What's wonderful about challah is that it can be used in so many ways: to sanctify the Sabbath, of course, but just as important, to make French toast, grilled cheese, and croutons and as breading in meatballs. Maybe not the way God intended it, but I'm sure She understands. Israel is the land of milk and honey, and this challah has both. For those of you who want to stay away from milk, it's fine to substitute water.
5015280~Red wine and pancetta add richness to the dish, but good beef broth really takes it to the next level.

5015289~For a lighter version, wrap the fish in very large butter lettuce leaves.
5017938~This Argentinian sauce is served with both grilled meats and fish. Its spice and herbal flavors go well with the smokiness imparted by the grill, and the vinegar’s bite cuts through the richness of steak.
5015291~Highly recommended!
5015292~Highly recommended!
5015293~We love chef Michael Solomonov's hummus all by itself, but it's also an incredible foundation for any seasonal toppings, from harissa-spiced shaved carrots to spiced black-eyed peas to fresh spring peas and pickled onions.
5015294~Highly recommended!
5015295~A classic rendition of the summer favorite. For something a little different, Cash sometimes adds two-thirds cup chopped fresh cilantro and two teaspoons curry powder.

5015299~After sampling hundreds of brownies in the Gourmet magazine test kitchens, along with baking countless more at home (my first was from the cult classic Betty Crocker's Cook Book for Boys and Girls), I feel qualified to declare my pride in this brownie. It's old-fashioned in its use of unsweetened chocolate, yet the addition of cocoa takes it to the deeper, darker chocolate place we crave these days.

5015311~It's low in fat and high in lycopene (a potential cancer fighter). Dig in!
5015312~For the moistest, most intense mostaccioli imaginable, Miraglia Eriquez increased the cocoa, hazelnuts, and spices. And these little frosted cookies only get better with age, so feel free to bake them up to four days ahead of when you plan to serve them.

5015323~"Lee believes that classic dishes are far from being precious artifacts; they are inherently adaptable, and that's what makes them timeless. The starting point here was his ""very Italian"" wine importer, Enrico Battisti, but instead of polenta, Lee uses quick-cooking stone-ground grits from Anson Mills, in Columbia, South Carolina.""They're better than any polenta,"" he says, ""because they're so fresh. I call them hero grits."""
5015324~Total cost: $9.96
5015325~The key to this deeply flavored cheesecake? Reduced maple syrup. The sweet-tart compote is a delicious—and pretty—accompaniment.
5015971~Long-grain rice won't do the trick here; short- and medium-grain have the perfect texture for the clay-pot chicken, not quite absorbing the sauce but supporting it in a delicious way.

5015340~This crispy sandwich gets a double hit of heat, thanks to a tangy Tabasco sauce brine and cayenne-spiked coating. A crisp buttermilk slaw and creamy herbed mayo spread provide refreshing flavor and a perfect counterbalance to the spice.
5015341~Who doesn't love Rice Krispies treats? By adding dark chocolate ganache with a tiny jolt of coffee flavor, we've turned the classic into a sophisticated and whimsical bite-size dessert. We found that combining bittersweet chocolate of different cacao levels results in a ganache that has just the right intensity without being overpowering.
5015342~Chervil's delicate anise flavor enhances the season's baby vegetables. If you don't have chervil, substitute fresh dill.

5015351~Puréeing beet greens into pesto and tossing asparagus ribbons into fettuccine is a great way to incorporate healthy vegetables into pasta. A poached egg adds richness and protein to the dish. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, reserve the beets for the Beet Risotto and 4 ounces of asparagus for the Frittata with Fennel-Spiced Pork and Asparagus .
5016490~Because beets are sweet and earthy, they need a good helping of acidity and salt to brighten them up. Immediately after cooking, dress beets in vinaigrette and salt to let them marinate. Blue cheese or crème fraîche offer sufficient tang for this salad if goat cheese is not available. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, reserve the greens from the beets and the remaining Swiss chard stems and greens for the Sautéed Greens with Walnuts . Buy a bunch of radishes and save the rest for the Carrot and Radish Salad with Tuna and Capers .
5019709~This is an elegant risotto that's fairly straightforward, though a bit messy if you're using red beets. Yellow or red, the color is spectacular and the taste will have those averse to eating beets rethinking the root. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, reserve the greens from the beets for the Fettuccine with Asparagus, Beet Green Pesto, and Poached Egg .
5015354~Raw vegetable salads are so easy to make and surprising tasty. When thinly sliced, an otherwise bitter vegetable like the radish morphs into a sweet, crisp salad. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, reserve 2 radishes from your bunch for the Roasted Beet Salad with Flash-Pickled Radishes and Chard .
5015355~Highly recommended!
5015356~Served warm or at room temperature, a frittata makes for an easy yet impressive dinner. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, buy 1 bunch asparagus and use 3/4 bunch for the Fettuccine with Asparagus, Beet Green Pesto, and Poached Egg and the remaining 1/4 bunch here. This is the perfect opportunity to use up any leftover beet green pesto from the pasta dish as well.
5015357~Farro is a nutty-flavored grain that's popular in Tuscany. It's not as heavy as some other whole grains, but it's still packed with protein, fiber, magnesium, and vitamins A, B, C, and E. Here, it's the base for a satisfying summer salad.
5015358~Make the filling ahead of time and you'll need only a few minutes to go from shucking to eating.
5015359~Any salty hard cheese, such as an aged Manchego, Grana Padano, or Mimolette, would be a fine substitute for the Parmesan. This recipe is from Caitlin Williams Freeman's upcoming cookbook, The Blue Bottle Craft of Coffee.

Most often they're simply what you throw into a soup or a braised dish to ""add a little sweetness."" But it's because of that inner sweetness that they're so suited to charring on a chapa. The sugar caramelizes and produces a delicious crust. They are tossed with nutty garlic chips, peppery arugula, and creamy goat cheese."

5015371~New England tradition is behind this hearty soup supper. A mixture of tangy cheddar, Port wine and Dijon mustard produces a terrific spread to nibble on while the chowder is cooking. Pour Sauvignon Blanc throughout the meal.

Thankfully, the dough is a dream to roll out, and it's strong enough to keep the shape of the cookie-cutters you use, no matter how intricate. Want to hang them on the tree? Just cut a little hole before baking with the narrow end of a pastry bag tip. Keep this recipe handy for when you've got a houseful of kids on a school break and need a project to get them off their cell phones!"

5015386~Martini fans will find that this simple and elegant appetizer goes perfectly with their favorite cocktail.
5015387~Old-fashioned green goddess dressing tastes as good today as it did back in the twenties, when it was invented. It's a delicious partner for mixed greens, chicken salad, cold poached salmon and sliced tomatoes.
5015388~Highly recommended!
5019789~Basic is best when it comes to piecrust. There's no need to fiddle with this multipurpose flaky pastry.

5015391~"Lauren Beal of San Rafael, California, writes: ""When it comes to making dinner, my husband, Stuart, and I have the perfect system. He's in charge of our backyard garden, and I'm in charge of cooking with what he harvests — things like basil, onions, lemons, and even apples. It's our favorite way to create a meal together."""
5015392~If you grew up in Northern California in the 1990s, you lived through the trend that was sprouts. From alfalfa sprouts to bean sprouts, they seemed to find their way into every green salad, sandwich, and omelet. This savory whole-grain breakfast bowl is inspired by those California days, with chunks of ripe avocado, crumbled Cotija cheese, toasty almonds, and a citrus-sparked yogurt sauce. While alfalfa sprouts were prevalent when I was growing up, today I try to branch out, using a tangle of colorful bean sprouts or more delicate radish or sunflower sprouts. These morning bowls couldn't be easier to prepare, but the barley does take a while to cook; I put a pot on the stove first thing in the morning so it'll be ready by the time I've had my coffee and prepped the other ingredients. Feel free to experiment with other grains, too. I've tried this with both quinoa and farro, and it's as wonderful with delicate grains as it is with heartier ones.
5015393~Tuna and 'shrooms contain two different umami compounds that work synergistically to enhance the savory flavor. This dish is the lightest of this noodly bunch, with only 350 calories per bowl.
5015394~This is such a sweet little dessert. As you know, I’m not one for sweet treats but this is a little pop of yumminess—perfect for dinner parties, and it won’t leave your guests rolling around on the floor with indigestion.
5015395~Highly recommended!
5015396~"Pork tenderloin goes perfectly with sweet baby carrots. The bags of machine-cut ""baby"" carrots contain too much moisture and wont roast nicely. Instead, use true baby carrots or larger carrots cut into long, slender fingers about the size of young carrots."
5019748~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 1 hr
5015398~The more particular you are when building the layers in the loaf pan, the more neat and tidy this will look when sliced. But if it’s a little uneven and the layers blend together, so be it!

5015407~We typically think of pickling as involving mainly vinegar or, as is the case with kimchi, a fermenting process. In India, however, oil is the secret ingredient, employed to carry the flavor of spices. Here, mustard seeds and ground turmeric bring brightness to the mix.
5015408~This flavorful lemongrass marinade is pretty common in Vietnam, where it's used on thin pork chops that are quickly grilled over a hot fire. Because the marinade has a lot of sugar, grilling the meat is the only way to go. If you try to pan-fry the pork chops, the sugar will burn before the meat is cooked through.

Despite my training, nothing prepared me for the pressures of working in a fast-paced kitchen, or in a restaurant of such high quality. I think my success came down to sheer effort and a lifelong passion for cooking. Even as a kid I loved playing with cookie and pie dough."

5015437~Homemade, at least the way Self does it, fills you up without filling you out, but it takes an hour to make. Freeze the leftovers for quick meals that are more healthful than most of the ones you find in the freezer section of the supermarket.
5015438~Hungry guests still rubbing the sleep from their eyes will be delighted to encounter this satisfying spin on that old diner favorite, the Western omelet. But it's just as nice for dinner, served with some roasted potatoes and a salad. This frittata is a great one to have in your recipe arsenal when you're faced with some leftover breakfast sausage (from our Sausage-Stuffed Potatoes with Green Salad, for example).
5015439~This simple, comforting, home-style dish evolved after the Meiji Restoration, when beef entered the Japanese diet. You can easily use pork or chicken instead of the beef. Enjoy it on a snowy winter night with a side of greens.

5015449~In South Louisiana, any sauce is called gravy. This dish would be our equivalent of biscuits and sausage gravy, except we've got all this seafood down here that finds its way into nearly everything. Serve this gravy over biscuits ) with Oeufs au Plat , and you've really got something. As a chef, I make this a bit more complicated than it needs to be: I start with the shrimp in the pan, then remove them so they don't overcook, and then I add them back once it's all come together.

5015461~Any side dish or salad that includes corn is pretty, but fava beans and striking-looking breakfast radishes—with their elongated shape, rosy red color, and creamy-looking root ends—make this dish more appealing and appetizing than most. Like most chefs, I love favas, but if you can’t find them or think they are too much trouble, replace them with lima beans.
5017514~Wear gloves when working with chiles.
5015463~Adding pretzels to the caramel gives these over-the-top bars a crunchy texture and salty-sweet finish.

Used in this go-with for the chops, it brings new meaning to ""sweet-and-sour pork."" Pomegranate molasses is available at some supermarkets and Middle Eastern markets and by mail from Adriana's Caravan (800-316-0820; adrianascaravan.com)."

5015492~Duck breast is a sadly underrated meat. Served rare to medium-rare and sliced on the diagonal, it has the mineral tang of beef. This southwestern version, with its slightly spicy sauce, elicits every ounce of flavor from the bird. And it's so easy!
5015493~Instead of the usual approach of topping dandelion greens with hot bacon dressing, here we tame the greens' bitter bite with a Spanish-inspired dressing flavored with almonds, raisins, and Sherry.
5015494~Highly recommended!
5015495~Other top-quality blue cheeses-like Maytag, Danish or Roquefort-are fine replacements for the Stilton. And if arugula is unavailable, choose another slightly bitter salad green, such as curly endive, chicory or baby salad greens; spinach mixed with some watercress would also work quite well.

5018360~Baking the potatoes first gives them a nice creamy texture. The potency of the mustard will diminish as the potatoes are being stirred over the burner; so if you really want to feel the burn, add an extra teaspoon or so of mustard just before serving.
5015504~If it grows together, it goes together: Sweet and sour from the rhubarb and herbaceous from the fennel, this drink is pure harmony.
5015505~Transform jarred roasted red peppers into a fresh and flavorful dip seasoned with cumin and a pinch of cayenne.
5015506~An indication of knowing someone really well is knowing which foods they love, like, and hate. My father loves this recipe, and I was told by Kyria Loula, who knew him as a boy, that it had to go into the book just for him. If you follow his taste buds, the more garlic the better. If you follow mine, start slow, taste as you go, and add more garlic as needed.

5015510~In India, lentil-based dals are often served as a side dish, but adding a host of vibrant vegetables turns this into a main course. Brightened with turmeric and infused with garlic, ginger, and spices, the red lentils are cooked down into a creamy purée. Best of all, the flavor improves with time, so make it ahead for a night when you need a quick supper.
5015511~If Chilean sea bass is unavailable, any sea bass is fine to use. Score the fish on the skin side, so it won't curl.

A dollop of freshly beaten cream melds the two beautifully.

5016128~Remember icebox pies? And how the flavor of butterscotch always seems to melt extra slowly on your tongue? The lighter-than-air quality of the creamy filling, along with the crunch of the pecan topping, make every bite of this cooling pie a real treat.
5015540~Plain sugar cookies, no matter how well they are made, are a bit boring to me. You may think I have gone off the rails by adding curry powder to cookies, but along with the ground and candied ginger, the combo really wakes up a classic American cookie. Give these a shot!
5015541~Boneless chicken thighs give a moist result, but chicken breasts work well, too. Mix wild mushrooms with cultivated button mushrooms for a deeper flavor. Goes great with: Mashed potatoes flecked with chopped fresh parsley or tarragon. What to drink: Chardonnay or Merlot.

5015548~There's lots of bold flavor in this hearty stuffing, which, though inspired by a classic Italian combination, happens to work in perfect concert with everything on the American holiday table. Baking it in a wide dish yields plenty of crusty top for everyone.
5015549~This recipe—inspired by a similar dish served at the fabulously fast-paced lunch counter Cal Pep, in Barcelona, Spain—is terrific with pork chops or roast chicken.
5015550~Chayote (often mistaken for a squash) is a fruit with a cucumber-like taste and texture. The sweet-spicy balance of this appetizer goes well with Sauvignon Blanc or beer.
5015551~A warming beef chili gets serious depth from toasted chiles and a touch of sweetness from squash.
5015552~Great served warm or at room temperature.
5015553~With uniformly sized fillets, the cooking time can be gaged precisely, resulting in the kind of lovely individual pieces of salmon served in restaurants. For four servings, buy one and a half pounds of skinned salmon fillets, taken from the thick (not the tail) end of the fish. Cut across the fillet to make four pieces of equal size.
5015554~This curry is doubly rich from the coconut milk and the deep red curry, but the pineapple keeps it from being too heavy and gives a beautiful freshness to the dish. I like to cook the lobster in the shell because it makes for a more flavorful sauce, and I like to serve it that way too. You can be as refined as you like or, like me, pick up the shell and make an animal of yourself. If lobster is going to blow the budget, you can still have a delicious curry by substituting shrimp or monkfish.
5015555~Marsha also uses this versatile sauce (based on the Spanish sauce called romesco) as a pasta sauce, as a dip and on garlic toasts as an hors d'oeuvre.
5015556~We serve our remake of the Mojito—a Cuban cocktail—in lime bowls, but Martini glasses would also look sleek.

5015583~These are eaten throughout Scandinavia, but they are especially popular in Denmark. The Swedish version would have more sugar; the Swedes like sweeter food than the other Scandinavians.

5015602~Fragrant, fiery chile-pepper water is an essential condiment on the Hawaiian table, where a few drops of the stuff transforms even stodgy cutlets and lumpen beef stews into something almost magical.
5015603~Root vegetables became a mainstay of the New England diet. The crops grew well during the summer and could be stored in barrels of sand or in root cellars to keep through the long winter. This spectacular casserole has potatoes, parsnips, turnips and carrots, and is sweetened with just a hint of pear. The pureed vegetables are swirled together in the baking dish to create a pretty marbled effect.

5015610~This is another good recipe for skinless, boneless chicken breasts since the olive oil compensates for the dryness of the meat, but if you prefer, by all means, leave the skin on. For the finest flavor and texture, use chicken breasts from naturally raised free-range birds. For extra garlic flavor, serve it with Lebanese toum bi zeit (garlic sauce) . Precede it with a chilled gazpacho and serve the chicken with fresh pita bread or slices of a crusty country loaf and a massive green salad for a memorable summer Sunday lunch.

The moist buttermilk cake requires no trimming, the cream cheese frosting is much more simple (and just as stable) as wedding cake's typical buttercream, and edible flowers and pretty raspberries make decorating a breeze.
5015615~Pouring a citrusy vinaigrette over hot grilled pork chops enhances their flavor and balances their richness. The chops go extremely well with the black-bean and tomato quinoa
5015616~"Steve Silverman of South Burlington, Vermont, writes: ""In my cooking I tend to be very quick and health-conscious.

5015618~We are always wowed by how complex in both flavor and texture hand-milled grits are compared to their supermarket counterpart, which we don't recommend for this particular recipe. Grits are best when freshly cooked, but if you're making an entire menu, you'll probably want to prepare them the day before (see cooks' note, below). We suggest storing raw grits in the refrigerator until you're ready to cook them.

5015622~In our Egg Salad with Lemon and Fennel , fennel contributes juicy crunch and a nice hit of bright flavor. Here, the leftover fennel goes in a decidedly different direction: Candied in a sugar syrup, it has a softer snap and becomes more mellow. Along with pistachios, golden raisins, and fennel seeds, it makes a sophisticated filling for baked Gala apples. Many baked–apple recipes are too homey for company, but this version, with its spectrum of greens and golds, would be the highlight of any dinner party menu.
5015623~Chowders are by far my favorite kinds of soup and often feature at our table on a Saturday lunchtime. The best, I think is clam, followed closely by finnan haddie. If you can, try and buy some really good-quality undyed finnan haddie, which has a more subtle flavor than some of the others.
5015624~For variety, dip half of the biscotti in melted white chocolate and the other half in dark chocolate. Or, drizzle the melted chocolate over the biscotti instead.

5015634~Buffalo meat can be very red, even when cooked to medium-rare. Don't be alarmed — this is a naturally occurring phenomenon that has to do with the animal's diet and how little fat is marbled through the muscle. While testing this recipe, we learned that buffalo meat varies in quality; the purveyors whose meat we like best are Wild Idea Buffalo Company (866-658-6137; wildideabuffalo.com), Jackson Hole Buffalo Meat Company (800-543-6328; jhbuffalomeat.com), Arrowhead Buffalo Meats (877-283-2969; arrowheadsteaks.com), and D'Artagnan (800-327-8246; dartagnan.com).

5015648~Flavored creams (rose cream, geranium cream) served with berries are common in Britain. This take on the classic is a mix of drained yogurt and fromage blanc (fresh cream cheese). The soft, not too-sweet creams taste like a cross between an American-style pudding and a panna cotta. Keep in mind that the desserts need to chill at least eight hours.
5015649~Chunks of tender cauliflower and potato tossed with Indian spices give this stuffing a lovely, distinctive texture and flavor.
5015650~This recipe for raw vegetables is the only conscionable thing you can serve right before sitting down to a heavier meal.
5015651~I am a big fan of rugelach made with cream cheese, so I used soy cream cheese to make these. There are so many different fillings for rugelach; my favorite is apricot jam or chocolate. It is fun to make different flavors so that when you place them on a platter, you see rows of different color swirls. In my baking classes, I give the students a buffet of choices so they can create their own combinations. Here I've given you three fillings to choose from. If you prefer to make one type, simply double one of the filling recipes (each filling amount is enough for half the dough). Or you can divide the dough into four and make four typesany flavor of jam, coconut, raisins, currants, or any kind of chopped nuts make great fillings.

Green, red, or Tuscan kale (sometimes called lacinato or dinosaur kale) would all be delicious. 3 pounds kale (about 4 large bunches), thick bottom stems and center stems cut away and discarded

We poured it over the mashed potatoes, dressing and turkey, then over open-face sandwiches the next day. Of course, it's great with this turkey, too: The bird gets its incredible moistness from being soaked overnight in a brine enhanced by thyme, garlic cloves and honey.""Because of the brining process, we don’t recommend stuffing this turkey."

""Like a traditional Pimm's Cup, this recipe works well with other spirits, including bourbon, rum, and tequila,"" he says. ""You have my permission to experiment."" St-Germain liqueur, made from Alpine elderflowers, brings a floral note."

5015695~This elegant entrée deserves special accompaniments, like buttered baby carrots sprinkled with chopped tarragon, twice-baked potatoes (available frozen) and a spinach salad tossed with toasted walnuts. New-York-style cheesecake with strawberries provides the properly indulgent finale.
5015696~"Christine Warren of New York, New York, writes: ""On a recent evening out on the town, my friends and I decided to go for Margaritas at Zarela.

5015698~The mixture of fruit in this dessert, a long-standing menu item at The Marx Bros. Cafe in Anchorage, might include anything from wild Alaskan blueberries to apples, depending on the time of year.

5015704~Use this soup as a chance to show off rich, slow-simmered homemade beef broth, or take a shortcut and use a store-bought base. Either way, you'll enjoy the fragrant and fresh flavors of this Vietnamese classic. Fish sauce, which adds a savory (and non-fishy) depth to the broth, is available in the Asian section of most supermarkets.
5015705~With authentic Asian flavor, this soup is a perfect light supper.
5015706~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5017536~Cooking the sea bass in parchment paper is a great technique — it keeps the pistachio topping in place and allows you to brown both the fish and the topping in the skillet (the parchment becomes translucent so you can see the browning. Since Gras is on the West Coast, he likes to use Dungeness crab when he makes this dish. We've substituted jumbo lump crabmeat because it's available year round nationwide.
5015708~If your dad is anything like ours, he’s going to love these spiced-up grilled lamb chops.
5015709~Highly recommended!
5015710~If you live near a Chinese market, pick up barbecued or smoked duck there. Otherwise, smoked chicken or turkey from the supermarket (or leftover roast chicken) would be terrific tossed with the noodles. To make it a meal, add a platter of chilled silken tofu. Drizzle the tofu with soy sauce and chili sauce, then top with chopped green onions. Coconut ice cream with fresh berries and lychees would make a nice dessert.
5015711~Lemon curd separates the layers of this fine-crumbed, very-special-occasion cake. Get started at least one day ahead: The frosting base and lemon curd must chill overnight before using. For the frosting, high-quality white chocolate (such as Lindt or Perugina) works best.
5015712~Terrific with roast chicken, lamb or steak.
5015713~"""One of my favorite restaurants in Providence is Neath's,"" writes Emily Hughes of Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""On my most recent and memorable trip, I had my preferred dessert — chocolate wontons with ginger ice cream. Can you procure this recipe from chef Neath Pal?"""

5015715~For a little less heat, omit the chiles or mustard seeds.
5015716~"Homemade bread crumbs are one of those ""chefs secrets""—an important but often overlooked detail that can make a dish. These easy-to-make crumbs are flaky, mild, and versatile—they dont have that heavy whole-wheat taste and dense texture that most store-bought brands have. Since bread crumbs are a comfort-food cornerstone used in everything from cutlet coatings to casserole toppings, its key to have the best."
5015717~Canned mangoes are excellent in this dessert if ripe fresh ones are unavailable. Use a drained (1-lb 14-oz) can of mango slices in syrup. If the canned fruits you buy are Alphonso mangoes (our favorite variety of mango), add an additional 1/2 cup cream.

5015737~We've learned from experience that, because goose gives off so much fat in roasting, it's necessary to use a deep (at least 2 inches) roasting pan (do not use a non-stick pan). We also recommend using a metal bulb baster — the hot goose fat may melt a plastic one.

And Brazil has enjoyed spectacular success exporting its rodizio-style restaurants—the kind where the waiters parade spits of grilled meats through the dining room. But Colombia? I doubt that most North Americans could name a single Colombian grilled dish. Well, it's time to shine the spotlight on the only country in South America to have coasts on both the Atlantic and the Pacific, whose cool-weather ranching district produces well-marbled, full-flavored beef, whose grill masters make extensive use of marinades (unlike the simplicity prized by their Argentine counterparts), and whose mastery of the art of grilling on charcoal extends to some unique techniques. Here's a not-so simple flank steak redolent of cumin, green onions, and beer.

5015749~Cranberries are transformed with sweet, subtly earthy dried figs and velvety, slightly spicy Pinot Noir into a chunky, jamlike chutney. Orange zest infuses the mix with its bright citrus flavor and essential oils. Ginger works well in both savory and sweet preparations, and its touch of heat bridges the wine and fruit here. You can serve this chutney instead of the standard cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving, but it is also wonderful with pork and venison dishes, spread on a sandwich, or as an accompaniment to a cheese plate.
5015750~Crown roasts are often done with pork, but lamb also makes for a festive presentation—and it's a delicious change of pace. Request the roasts from the butcher ahead of time, since they are usually prepared to order. Pour a Syrah with dinner if you've chosen this main course.

This is a lighter version baked in a modern oven, but we kept the traditional step of pouring milk or cream over the top of the pudding before cooking it."
5015765~You need only a small amount of beer to flavor the sauce. We trust you know what to do with the rest of that bottle.
5015766~Sliders are simple, but perfecting them is a bit of an art. It’s all about getting the three main components—the sauce, the filling and the bread—in the right ratio. We’ve got the sauce and filling covered, so all you need to do is get some fresh bread.
5015767~Churrasco de Sao Paolo al la Parilla con Chimichurri Rojo
5015768~I adore lentils, particularly the green French variety, as well as the little black ones, sometimes known as beluga lentils because of their resemblance to caviar. Both of these types hold their shape better than the typical brown lentil, and their nutty texture and flavor are divine. This is my favorite fall salad, made a bit indulgent with the addition of prosciutto. I first made this for an autumnal baby shower, and it was a major hit. The earthiness of the lentils and prosciutto plays wonderfully off the color and sweetness of autumn's bounty of peppers. This salad works equally well with meat, chicken, or fish. Best of all, it can be served at room temperature, and tastes even better the next day. So, make the salad the day before, heat up the grill, pop a few corks, and enjoy the sunshine!
5015769~Serve with: Gingered rice pilaf and summer lettuces with a sesame vinaigrette.
5015770~Offer with crusty French bread and you have a satisfying summer supper. The creamy dressing is lower-fat version, using half yogurt and half mayonnaise.

5015779~Buy some potato salad and raw vegetable sticks to round out the menu; then offer fudgy chocolate cupcakes for dessert.
5015780~This soup looks thick but doesn't taste at all heavy. In fact, it has an almost billowy texture, but with enough substance to still be satisfying. The addition of just a small amount of toasted almonds adds some crunch to the equation.

5015784~This take on the classic couldn’t be easier: Instead of dredging and panfrying, just stack the ingredients in two stages on a baking sheet and broil. Done this way, the tomatoes get lightly roasted and the bread crumbs stay nice and crunchy.
5015785~"Marie G. Beltran of Seattle, Washington, writes: ""The signature dish at Blue Onion Bistro here in Seattle is a rich, velvety macaroni made with blue cheese.

5015796~Mahimahi is on of Hawaii's most popular fish; firm-fleshed and mild-flavored, it can be cooked in almost any manner and cloaked in almost any sauce. I like the flavor of citrus with mahimahi, enhanced by some spicy peppercorns. Sweet bananas, a hint of coconut, and macadamia nuts add to the tropical flavors in this light dish.
5015797~This entire dish is right out of Rose and Ruthie's River Café playbook, with just a few tweaks of my own. They taught me how to make fonduta, a silky sauce rich with crème fraîche and egg yolks. It takes less time and just a bit more effort than tomato sauce, and turns a plate of pasta into an elegant and impressive meal. Get yourself some asparagus spears that are as thick as your pointer finger—not those thin or sprouty ones—and you'll enjoy the juicy slivers in each bite.
5015798~"Gail W. Dorsey of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, writes: ""Fresh figs were featured in an unusual appetizer at The Gatehouse Restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island.

At the restaurant, we use it to season everything from corn on the cob to chicken to our Spring booty taco. When cooking with it, just beware that it's quite salty. Also, it keeps for a long time, which means that you may want to make a double batch.
5015823~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015824~A light and flavorful way to cook fish.
5015825~Our all-time favourite snack — salty, spicy, dried meat — also makes a great garnish for salads, soups and vegetables when finely shaved with a sharp knife. Creative cooks even blend it into pâté to spread on toast. Drying meat and fish was a necessary method of preservation prior to refrigeration.
5019600~Serve this delicious curried chicken dish with steamed basmati rice or Indian flatbreads.
5015827~"Inspired by a dessert served at Le Bistro Paul Bert, in Paris, we used Indian spices to restyle this elegant classic custard. It takes its French name (""eggs in the snow"") from the lightly poached dollops of meringue that top it."
5015828~This light and spicy sauce is especially good on chicken. For convenience, you can mix the spices ahead, then add the vinegar just before using.
5015829~You know what never, ever goes out of style? Chocolate mousse.
5015830~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from The Skinny: How to Fit into Your Little Black Dress Forever by Melissa Clark and Robin Aronson.

5015832~Highly recommended!
5015833~I call this herb and spice rub North African because, besides the classic oregano and rosemary, it contains Tunisian and Moroccan spices such as caraway, cumin, and turmeric. In addition, it is spiked with harissa, the ubiquitous hot pepper paste that is to Arab North Africa what chile oil is to Asia. Use the same spice mixture to rub poultry, beef, or pork two to three hours before grilling and leave at room temperature. Or you can mix 3 tablespoons of this rub with 3 tablespoons yogurt and baste chicken breasts or legs or skewered lamb and pork before grilling. Better yet, leave in the spicy yogurt marinade in the refrigerator overnight.
5015834~"A spiedo is a kitchen spit over an open fire that is most often used for cooking whole animals, particularly chicken. Spiedino—;literally ""little spit""—refers to food cooked on skewers, which is how we like to prepare pork loin. Grilled briefly over a smoky fire, the meat takes on an addictive char that counterbalances the sweet, mellow soffritto of pine nuts, garlic, and currants."

5015842~Listen, this dish is indulgent, and makes a bit more than two responsible adults should finish in one sitting. But for crying out loud, live a little. (And anyway, the kale keeps it virtuous.)
5015843~The butter (yep, a whole stick) mellows the tart lemon sauce and is key to the finished texture.
5015844~Highly recommended!
5015845~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015846~Make these with fresh rhubarb when it is in season, from late winter through midsummer.
5015847~You can store celery root in the fridge, unpeeled, in an unsealed plastic bag, with a dry paper towel to absorb excess moisture, for up to 3 weeks.
5015848~A lovely combination of contrasting tastes: bitter greens, salty-smoky bacon, tangy goat cheese, and sweet shallots.
5015849~Raspberries or blackberries can be swapped in for the blueberries.
5015850~The delicate orange flavor of Aperol melds well with bitter lemon soda in this crisp cocktail.
5015851~"Marty Rosencranz of River Vale, New Jersey, writes: ""Even though I am a professional chef — at the Valley Brook Golf Club in New Jersey — when I cook at home I make dishes that are good but fast. I took two years to perfect the recipe for my chewy chocolate cookies. They're so good that they are now a signature item on the club's menu."""
5015852~Nice for lunch or dinner with some salad, or as a snack at teatime.

5015854~Team the fish with steamed rice and sautéed spinach, and pour a Sauvignon Blanc.

5015856~If you're using a commercial cold-brew maker like a Toddy, follow the manufacturer's instructions for mixing and filtering. Feel free to play around with how you dilute this—you might prefer a stronger or weaker coffee than the one suggested here. And coffee-heads the world over agree: cold-brew is only as good as the beans it's made with.
5015857~While reminiscent of a marinara sauce, red bell pepper, cognac, and jalapeño add hints of newness to this luscious, traditional favorite lobster dish.
5015858~Chef Graham Elliot, of restaurants Graham Elliot and Grahamwich in Chicago, shared this recipe as part of a Tree-Trimming Party Menu he created exclusively for Epicurious. Here's a salad that puts a twist on classic holiday flavors. Homemade smoked marzipan mingles with crisp prosciutto and caramelized figs on arugula dotted with a ricotta cream. If your ricotta is on the wet side, see our instructions for how to drain it, an important step before making the cream. The marzipan can be made up to five days in advance.
5015859~Highly recommended!
5015860~Crushed berries and cream over ice — of all the frappés, this is my favorite.

5015862~Highly recommended!
5015863~The aioli will appear quite tight when all the oil is incorporated, but it will loosen to a pourable consistency once the buttermilk and shallot are added.
5015864~Keep an eye on the edge of the meat where it touches the grill: When it's browned, turn the pork over.

5015871~"Brown Betty recipes started showing up in the late 1800s, although nobody is sure who ""Betty"" was. Traditionally, a brown Betty is made with apples, breadcrumbs, and spices. In this updated version, pears stand in for the apples and the breadcrumbs are enriched with almonds. Keep in mind that this dessert is best eaten the day it's made (but any leftovers would be nice for breakfast)."
5015872~In this recipe, butter lettuce is cooked in pan drippings for a quick side.
5015873~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5015874~Smoked almonds and black olives are our suggestions for this appetizer, but use any nut or olive that you like.
5015875~Instead of traditional baked pasta, we broiled mozzarella-topped penne and sausage to get that bubbly melted cheese everyone loves, minus a lot of oven time.
5015876~How do you impart the most flavor in a boil without overcooking the shrimp? Ice! Adding 4 cups of ice cubes to the pot as soon as the shrimp are cooked through allows them to continue to absorb the flavors of the boil without getting tough. For a classic meal, pair with corn on the cob and boiled potatoes, or serve as a starter for a crowd.
5015877~Highly recommended!
5015878~It takes one to two days to marinate the meat for this recipe, but it's worth it. These will be some of the best ribs you'll ever eat.

5015881~If you're short on time, you can substitute bottled red curry paste (we recommend Mae Ploy brand) for homemade, but the flavor will not be as nuanced. There will be some curry paste left over after making the jungle curry and steamed catfish. Simply stir the remainder together with unsweetened coconut milk to give chicken, shrimp, or mussels a Thai spin.

5015900~Stuffed peppers come out well on the grill if you don't make them too big. I like to mix ground meats and season the stuffed peppers heavily. Be sure to cook a little of the meat mixture to test the seasonings before you stuff the peppers, since the salt and spice levels of the various sausage meats and seasoning mixes vary widely.
5015901~Western stocks are loaded with aromatics and many Asian stocks include ginger. This simple stock has a pure chicken flavor.

5015903~These tomatoes are doused in a mixture of balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire, and garlic before going into the oven. The results are melt-in-your-mouth tomatoes with flavors reminiscent of homemade ketchup. Use it in Charred Romaine Greek Salad With Quinoa-Crusted Feta .

5015905~Linguiça is a garlic-flavored Portuguese sausage available at most supermarkets. Serve with: Frisée salad drizzled with a red wine vinaigrette.
5015906~Clotted cream is not a part of my own traditional food culture but it is a forgotten skill in everyday cooking and is so gorgeous and so easy to make that it is really worth doing every now and then.
5015907~Fresh sardines are nothing like their tinned cousins; their flavor is rich and far more delicate. Dressed with a miso glaze and augmented by rainbow carrots and fresh fennel, this is a wonderful, light meal.
5015908~Highly recommended!
5015909~"This recipe is inspired by a cranberry pie from Sarah Chase's book Cold Weather Cooking. My friend Barbara Liberman calls it ""easy cake""—I call it delicious. When cranberries are in season, serve it with vanilla ice cream and your friends will love you."
5015910~What to drink: Offer robust French roast coffee, but also a vintage or ruby Port.
5018517~I think we all play favorites in the kitchen; I know I do. At this writing, this is my most loved dressing, and I drizzle it on everything I can get my hands on!
5015912~This simple side dish can be served warm or at room temperature. To make sure the eggplant is not undercooked, keep an eye on the grill and move the eggplant around as needed.

5015926~Another delicious thing about this addictive dessert? The fritters can be fried up to two hours ahead, then rewarmed just before serving.
5015927~As convenient as store-bought duck confit is, we find that its quality tends to vary. Making your own allows you to control the spicing and the cooking time to produce a velvety piece of meat. This ancient preservation method has three parts: First you cure the duck legs in salt (drawing out the water in which microorganisms can live), then you slowly cook them in fat, and finally you store them fully covered in the cooking fat so air can't get in.
5015928~New York City's classic dessert gets a luxurious lift from chestnuts.
5015929~Gina: This colorful salad is one of my go-to recipes when I need something to satisfy a crowd, whether at a church potluck supper or a backyard barbecue. The champagne vinaigrette gives the beans a fresh, zippy flavor. For the best results, add the fresh beans to the salad just before serving, so they do not discolor.

5015945~In July, the abundance of ripe tomatoes means making your own tomato juice is a breeze, and fresh juice, in turn, means a truly superb Bloody Mary. With a range in the amounts of horseradish, Tabasco, and lemon juice, you can customize the drinks to your liking. The final flourish, rimming the glasses with sea salt and black pepper, adds a slight tingle to each sip.

5015962~Be sure to prepare the syrup at least a few hours before making drinks so that it has plenty of time to chill.
5015963~Figs combine beautifully with all sorts of salty flavors—prosciutto, for instance, or Gorgonzola, or, of course, bacon. They also add succulent, sumptuous texture.
5015964~To make your cocktail party more participatory, have your guests grill their own skewers. A hibachi is even more user-friendly than a grill, since the ends of the skewers hang out over the edge, eliminating the need for tongs. If you're cooking everything yourself, it's easiest to use a large grill or a broiler (see cooks' note, below) and serve the skewers in batches.
5015965~Adding onion delivers moisture; forming thicker patties prevents them from cooking too fast and drying out. Both steps are key when working with grass-fed ground beef.
5015966~Highly recommended!

5015970~Though this rich, intense, homey stew has the depth of a recipe handed down through generations, it's actually a modern interpretation, by Momofuku partner Joaquin Baca, of a Mexican stew he grew up eating, made with Japanese ingredients. And it's the best kind of comfort food: The dark greens, mushrooms, and burdock, braised with silky chicken in a savory broth, make this single dish feel like a satisfying, well-balanced meal.
5015971~Long-grain rice won't do the trick here; short- and medium-grain have the perfect texture for the clay-pot chicken, not quite absorbing the sauce but supporting it in a delicious way.
5015972~For years I carted cases of this citrus-flavored Cuban marinade back from Miami, til we started making it in the restaurant. The real thing is all tarted up with the juice of bitter oranges — nearly impossible to find. So we add a touch of lime juice to freshly squeezed orange juice to give it the right kick. It's one of the most versatile pantry ingredients you can make. Use it as a marinade for pork and chicken, pour it over cooked veggies or potatoes, or toss it with salad greens.
5015973~Traditional Greek skordalia is mostly garlic and olive oil with some potato or nuts added to thicken it. We flipped the ratio in this recipe: more potato, less garlic. Serve as a dip, or thin out with lemon juice and olive oil and use as a sauce for fish.
5015974~Highly recommended!
5015975~Southern cooks use their chile-infused vinegar to add a tart, floral kick to dishes like chicken or greens. You can also use it to wake up salad dressings. Customize it by adding bourbon or fruit liqueur and using your favorite chiles.

5016002~Grand Marnier and grated orange peel add a touch of elegance to this simple indulgence. Prepare the fondue just before serving, and keep it warm while dipping so that it will remain smooth. Use a traditional fondue pot, or place the pan of the fondue on an electric hot plate. Either way, be sure the heat is low; too much heat will cause the chocolate to burn. Angel food cake, pound cake and a variety of fresh and dried fruits make great accompaniments.

5016011~Fresh ricotta cheese (available at some supermarkets and at Italian markets) and good-quality olive oil are the keys to this great salty-sweet dish.
5016012~It's traditional to serve a whole chicken, including the head and feet, for Chinese New Year. The white meat symbolizes purity, and serving the entire bird represents unity. Plunging the chicken into ice water after poaching ensures that the meat is perfectly juicy and tender. A very simple but powerful dipping sauce tops it off. Use only a tiny amount — it's quite strong.

5016032~Think of these as the best part of French onion soup minus the broth. Better yet, they're in a form that's much easier to eat than the soggy wet bread, weighed down with cheese, that usually tops crocks of onion soup. Don't be surprised if these disappear before you get a chance to sample one yourself!
5016033~This chilly treat may well make your freezer more popular than the neighborhood ice cream truck. The lemony ice cream center is a bright contrast to the surrounding chewy coconut macaroons — and the sandwiches are easily held by eager little hands.

5016053~This simple soup can be eaten hot or cold, in winter, or in summer. Many are aware of the healing benefits of carrots, mainly the antioxidant-rich carotenoids that are known to pack anticancer powers. We love them because they're a simple and delicious food. Combine them with a hefty dose of gelatin-rich bone broth, a touch of lemongrass and ginger, and you're left with a bowl of soup that beats any sugar-laden cold-pressed juice on the market.

5016060~This dish has become a signature of Domenica chef Alon Shaya. Precooking the cauliflower in seasoned poaching liquid infuses it with flavor; roasting it makes it crisp.

5016062~Cups of this calming grain tea, extolled for its digestive properties, are poured throughout Korean meals as Westerners would provide water. In the winter, the tea is usually served hot, while in the summer months, it comes cool or at room temperature.
5016063~Highly recommended!
5016064~Here is a light and festive way to introduce a holiday meal. This elegant soup goes very well with Champagne.
5016065~We use fresh lemon juice for this vinaigrette as often as we do vinegar.
5016066~Highly recommended!
5016067~This smoky grilled meat will be a delicious addition to your barbecue repertoire. For a casual party, serve the lamb with grilled pita bread, grilled eggplant, and tzatziki so that guests can make their own Greek-inspired sandwiches. Timing note: The lamb needs to marinate overnight.

5016071~Talk about flower power. As every gardener knows, late summer brings a bumper crop of zucchini and, better yet, of zucchini blossoms—known in Italy as fiori di zucca. Here, the tender yellow-orange blooms are filled with ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and mint, then batter-fried. Served alongside an easy tomato sauce (dip as you like), they make an irresistible first course or, with the addition of a green salad, a satisfying main.

5016075~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 45 min
5016076~A simply spectacular main-course. Ask the butcher to grind any pork trimmings to use in the stuffing. Either hard cider or Pinot Noir would be delicious alongside.

5016083~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016084~The pastry for this tart is very light and crisp. For best results, handle it as little as possible and keep it cool. You will need a 12 1/2- by 1-inch fluted round tart pan with a removable bottom, available at cookware shops and by mail order from Bridge Kitchenware, tel. (800) 274-3435 or (212) 838-1901.

5016090~Highly recommended!
5016091~This recipe yields enough sauce to glaze three pounds of meat. We doubled it for the chicken and ribs at our barbecue party. You'll use about half to marinate and glaze the meat while cooking, and the rest as a condiment on the buffet for those who like it really saucy.
5016092~Homemade Panang Curry Paste is the spicy backbone of this velvety vegetarian curry from southern Thailand. Serve it with bowls of jasmine rice for a hearty lunch or dinner.
5016093~A generous sprinkling of gray sea salt provides a genuine crust. Slicing the meat against the grain keeps it juicy.

5016097~This cooked tomato salsa has a smooth, sauce-like texture that makes it perfect for dipping chips or drizzling over nachos.
5016098~Hanger steak is the king of what I call weeknight steaks, casual cuts of leanish meat that deliver delicious flavor without a lot of expense or fuss. The skinny strip of flesh tastes best cooked hard and fast, for a crispy char on the outside, and left nice and pink inside. Slice it with a significant slant across the grain for the best eating texture. If you can find a grass-finished hanger steak, you’ll get leaner meat and a higher proportion of healthy lipids, such as omega-3s and CLAs. The bad news: hanger steak—or onglet, as it is sometimes known—can be hard to find. Even my regular butcher runs out somewhat frequently. Don’t fret—just substitute flank steak.
5016099~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Charlie Trotter and Roxanne Klein's book, Raw.
5016100~Everyone’s favorite bake sale treat goes gluten-free without any hard-to-find ingredients or alternative flours, just cornstarch and cocoa powder. Instant coffee or espresso powder deepens the chocolate flavor of this ultra-fudgy brownie.

5016111~"What you find here and on page 96—aside from a striking striped presentation—is an equally beautiful expression of flavors. Because both beets and pears are at the height of their season, Lee has no desire, as he says, ""to mess with them too much."" He adds, ""Nature trumps the ability of any chef."" The ginger juice in the vinaigrette is inspired by Lee's Asian roots."
5016112~Similar to zuppa inglese (an Italian trifle), this impressive dessert layers an amaretti-and-cream filling and orange segments between syrup-soaked sponge cake. Many of the components can be made ahead; start with the filling so that it can chill overnight.
5016113~Honey provides the sweet, and lemon juice the sour, in the Passover dish known as apio, which has origins in Turkey (the Ottoman Empire became a haven for Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition in 1492). As the celery cooks, it soaks up the braising liquid and becomes silky.

5016120~Dulce de leche literally translates to “candy of milk.” In layman’s terms, it’s a caramel-like concoction made from boiling sweetened condensed milk until it becomes . . . well, pretty much an eighth deadly sin. What I love most about dulce de leche is that it has the beautiful color and deep flavor of caramel, but not the chewiness . . . so you don’t have to expend needless energy flexing your jaw muscles.
5016121~These individual charlottes make an impressive finale to a special dinner. Start preparing them at least one day ahead.
5016122~Koji—a type of fermented rice used as seasoning in Japan—makes the meat in this roast chicken more tender, crisps up the chicken skin, and lends both sweet and savory notes.

5016124~There's really no other word for these burgers except: YUM. The flavoring and the satisfaction of a meal you can wrap your hands around is unmatched.

5016139~This is the baked terrine I like to make for Sunday lunch, served with all the traditional trimmings of roast vegetables, steamed greens, and Yorkshire puddings . Leftovers can be reheated and served midweek with gravy, steamed green beans, and a generous spoonful of horseradish on the side.

5016147~Japanese connoisseurs of the noodle hold soba, made primarily of buckwheat flour, in particularly high regard. Here the nutty taste of the soba noodles is set off by a restorative broth in which miso is a savory option. Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5016152~We love the way Dijon mustard enhances the similarly assertive flavor of the kale, while mellow pine nuts and Parmesan cheese balance it out. You can make this salad a day ahead; the flavors develop and deepen with a little extra time in the fridge. It's also delicious served warm or at room temperature.
5016153~Toasted pistachios, apricots, cinnamon and allspice bring great flavor to this accompaniment for the chicken.
5016154~Unlike supermarket ginger ales, which are made with carbonated water, corn syrup, and ginger flavoring, this spicy ginger beer is made the old-fashioned way, with lots of fresh grated ginger, sugar, yeast, and water. As the yeast ferments over a day or so, it creates a natural carbonation. Though many recipes leave the ginger sediment as is, we think straining it out produces a more refined quaff. For a different route to a similar drink, go to Homemade Ginger Ale.

5016159~The chef serves this salmon over a salad of romaine hearts, artichoke hearts, radishes, green beans, cucumber, potatoes, celery, scallion, olives, tomatoes, and basil with a dressing of lime juice and olive oil.
5016160~A Caribbean spin on the 150-year-old classic, this version infuses pineapple into Pisco (a South American brandy) and uses fresh grapefruit and lime peels for added brightness.

5016170~The fragrant richness of coconut oil and the tenderizing power of buttermilk make this the ultimate chocolate pound cake.
5016171~This classic truffle is made from a simple bittersweet ganache. Adding a few special ingredients makes these truffles anything but ordinary - for variations see balsamic truffles, mango curry truffles and meyer lemon and thyme truffles
5016172~We take potato dumplings to the next level by bathing them in cream, studding them with Gorgonzola dolce—a sweeter, milder variety of blue cheese—and topping them with crisp breadcrumbs.

5016182~A colorful salad that is refreshing alongside the lamb chops. Green or red bell peppers can be added to the salad, if you like.
5016183~The citrusy dressing makes this dish a standout, and there's plenty extra to be sopped up with rice or crusty bread. Cooking shrimp in their shells keeps them juicy and tender. It all makes for casual finger food that requires plenty of napkins — which is part of the fun.
5016369~You could bake this hunk of meat in an oven, but you'd be missing out on all that smoky flavor you'd be getting from the grill. Use this recipe for Bo Ssäm , Pork Banh Mi with Quick-Pickled Radishes and Carrots , and Summer Chef's Salad with Grilled Pork, Chicken, and Chimichurri Ranch Dressing , or just douse the meat with a little vinegar for a BBQ sandwich.
5016185~Highly recommended!
5016186~Giving the broccoli a head start on the salmon in this one-pan dish lets it get nicely browned, coaxing out its natural sweetness.
5016187~The more succulent the berries, the better. The cake layers absorb the juices, which is why this cake must be assembled at least 8 hours before serving.
5016188~The chicken should be falling-apart tender; if it starts to shred when you plate it, that’s a good sign!
5016189~Serve this with chicken salad.
5016190~A rich chocolate-raspberry truffle filling highlights this updated Linzertorte.

5016194~Good cooks never discard the nutritious beet greens. Here, the greens are combined with roasted beets, capers and feta in a Greek-inspired salad. Offer this before roast leg of lamb with crisp potatoes.
5016195~Artichokes and truffle cream make these poached eggs an elegant brunch dish. If you use porcini (cèpes in French), leave the stems attached but trim the side and bottom of each stem well.
5016196~Look for meaty ribs that aren't over-trimmed; the bones on top shouldn't show through. This recipe doubles or triples easily.
5019801~This recipe is from Eben Freeman, bartender of Tailor Restaurant in New York City. For this classic cocktail, essentially a gin sour with a cherry garnish, Freeman believes that the quality of the ingredients is paramount. He prefers Maraska maraschino liqueur, which has a cleaner and less funky flavor than other brands, and he replaces the traditional, artificially flavored maraschino cherry with a homemade version. For instructions on making homemade maraschino cherries, see the bartender's note, below, or simply substitute a pitted fresh cherry.

5016209~Although the base of this fairly standard Vietnamese dish is a caramel sauce, the garlic, shallots, and black pepper cut through the sweetness like a knife, providing terrific contrast. Since the last 45 minutes of the cooking time are unattended, this is a good dish for a night on which you want to entertain.
5016210~A yellow cake gets filled with jam then cleverly surrounded by a rhubarb mousse by using a larger spring-form pan as a mold. A jewel-like rhubarb glaze creates a finishing touch. If you have small, early tri-star or wild strawberries to garnish the top, so much the better!
5016211~Note that the chops need to marinate for at least three days, so begin preparing this dish well in advance. What to drink: A white wine with snappy acidity and lemon-lime notes, like dry Riesling or Grüner Veltliner.
5016212~This dinner for two is quick and healthy: Everything cooks in just one large skillet. And the final dish is loaded with vitamins, minerals, and omega-3s. To round out this recipe and riff on its Mediterranean feel, serve the salmon with couscous tossed with roasted pistachios.

5016214~"""One thing I cannot get out of my head"" said Ben Moskovitz, owner of Star Bakery in Oak Park, Michigan. ""Was the food better growing up in Czechoslovakia or were the people hungrier there? My mother made a honey cake for the holiday, and it was so delicious. Honey was too expensive for us, so my mother burned the sugar to make it brown. Here I use pure honey, but I still think my mother's cake was better and I know I am wrong. The taste of hers is still in my mouth."""

5016221~Here, chorizo replaces the usual steak or chicken.
5016222~Cold noodle dishes are a great way to cool off, and since both calamari and rice-stick noodles require little cooking, the combination makes for an excellent lunch or dinner on a hot, lazy day. With its generous amount of fragrant garden herbs, this salad even smells refreshing.

5016234~"These are very similar to crêpes—the staple of Brittany—but thinner and more delicate (and the filling is like nothing you'll find in the French tradition). Though they're often called ""Philippine Egg Rolls,"" lumpia —again, like most crêpes—require no cooking once they're filled."

5019053~This is used in four of the dishes in the menu; the recipe makes enough for them all.
5016237~Cobb salad was created at the Brown Derby, which opened in Los Angeles in 1926. Owner Robert Cobb placed diced vegetables, chicken and cheese on a bed of greens, and topped it all with his French dressing. Most of the ingredients for this recipe can be found at supermarket salad bars.
5016238~Oeufs en Meurette
5016239~Broccoli rabe and pasta, crowned with golden shards of garlic and zapped with a touch of chile heat, is one of the fastest dinners to make, and definitely one of the most satisfying. Because broccoli rabe is loaded with vitamins, minerals, and cancer-fighting bionutrients, I like to double up on the greens. Those who find broccoli rabe a bit bitter—it is a cousin of mustard—will find that the bitterness is greatly tamed by boiling it in lots of salted water with the pasta. You can embellish this basic rendition with bacon or sausage, but it's pretty darn delicious just as it is.
5016240~This pretty salad would be great alongside grilled sausages, chicken, or burgers.
5016241~The salt creates a seal around the fish, which preserves its moisture and pure flavors. Romesco is a classic sauce from the Catalonia region. For cooking the fish, use two 13x9x2-inch metal baking pans.
5016681~Serve this tender, moist Bundt cake with the Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote , vanilla ice cream, or just on its own. Decorate with whole strawberries, if desired.

5016245~Highly recommended!
5016246~From piña coladas to rum and coconut water, the fruit of the coco palm seems a natural pairing with the elixir of the cane reed. Here is a different twist on the rum and coconut theme—one that can be made in a larger quantity and kept on the sideboard or the bar until ready to serve. It only gets better.
5016247~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but may require additional sitting time.
5016248~The sweet-tart filling and the flaky crust add up to one terrific pie.
5016249~It's hard to improve on grilled cheese with tomato soup—but that's exactly what the folks at Noca are doing. The restaurant layers red heirloom tomatoes and smoked mozzarella on the sandwich. It transforms the soup with green heirlooms—and serves it cold. The mix of flavors, textures, and colors takes this classic to a new level.
5016250~This clever caramel sauce is made from coconut milk instead of the usual condensed milk.
5016251~These steaks are delicious served with creamed spinach and roasted new potatoes.
5016252~Fishcakes, like cakes of beef, would be nice served with a salad of beets and some horseradish or herb crème fraîche. Or with slaw and a spoonful of aïoli or other mayonnaise. Green beans and tomato vinaigrette?
5018150~The key to this crisp, flaky pastry is to handle the dough as little as possible and to keep it cool.
5016254~The timeless combination of steak and potatoes gets extra pep from jarred roasted peppers and aromatic charmoula, an herb and spice blend typically used in North Africa as an instant flavor booster for grilled meats and fish.
5016255~Don't have 60 minutes to roast a root vegetable? Try cooking yams in a microwave for about five minutes on each side and you'll have yams that are soft and ready to mash—fast.

5016259~Merguez, the spicy lamb sausages of North Africa, are popular throughout France. These nearly labor-free patties are a quick way to re-create them in your kitchen. The sweetness of the raisin couscous contrasts nicely with the meat's deep spice.
5016260~The best smoothies are made with very ripe fruit. Mango, pineapple and banana team up with light coconut milk in this one.
5016261~Highly recommended!
5016262~In this recipe, associate food editor Alexis Touchet uses pork to create a new sensation based on her mother's recipe for traditional chicken fried steak.
5016263~I first created this recipe at Routh Street Cafe in 1984. I've since had it on menus at five different restaurants in some form or another. It's also delicious when spread with a mixture of one part jalapeño jelly and three parts cream cheese whipped together. It's also best served warm.

5016267~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5016268~Frozen peas are a gift to the breakaway cook: their creamy, earthy goodness bursts with flavor, and they couldn’t be easier to store and prepare. The pesto-like tarragon emulsion, made even creamier by the addition of Greek yogurt, really brings out the best in them, and the sprinkling of pistachios on top lends a lovely toasted, nutty texture. Try them with a broiled fish fillet and a glass of grassy Sauvignon Blanc.
5016269~This silky, cheesy dip celebrates New Mexico's famous hatch chiles, which are only available in the late summer and early fall. If you are lucky enough to see them at the market, be sure to bring some home. Enjoy them right away or roast before freezing to enjoy year-round (or buy some of the great frozen options available). And skip the fancy cheese counter for this recipe: You'll achieve a smoother queso texture with super-melty cheese from the dairy aisle of the supermarket.

5016275~This spicy Sichuan dish gets its layers of flavor from two different types of heat: fiery chiles and mildly numbing Sichuan peppercorns.
5016276~Although this main-course salad sounds suspiciously Waldorfesque—it includes walnuts, celery, and apple—the fresh vinaigrette gives it a modern flair that sets it apart from its mayonnaise-dressed muse.

5016281~Fresh blackberries are plentiful in July and August, but since we must use frozen in the winter, be sure they're individually quick-frozen (available in plastic bags in the supermarket). Don't use berries packed in syrup.

5016283~Barley has nice heft and chew, but don't feel limited–use cooked farro, quinoa, or brown rice if you prefer.
5016284~Although tomatoes and aromatic herbs always complement each other, tender sprigs of fresh mint seem to have a special affinity for tomatoes. In this soup the mint is a sprightly highlight that serves as a refreshing foil to the richness of the cream. Other fresh herbs, such as thyme or basil, can be substituted and the soup will still be very tasty, but you really owe it to yourself to make this recipe with mint at least once. As for the tomatoes, if it's summertime choose the ripest, freshest ones you can find (a pinch of sugar will bring out their natural sweetness); at other times of the year canned will do just fine. Serve with a basket of hot garlic bread and a tossed vegetable salad.
5016285~"Daryl Getman of New York City, NY, writes: ""I'm a second-year theater student at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, so most days are more about running from class to rehearsal to a performance than they are about cooking. But since I moved out of the dorms last year, cooking has become my favorite distraction. And on the weekends, it's my idea of a break."""

5016291~Clyde's Restaurant Group owns several successful restaurants in the Washington, D.C., area. Tom Meyer, head of restaurant development, is especially fond of this popular dish, served with mashed potatoes at Clyde's of Chevy Chase. If you can't find broccoli rabe (an Italian green), collard greens, Swiss chard or mustard greens will work well also.
5016292~Briny shellfish give this quick bouillabaisse its depth of flavor. Basil rouille (a garlicky Provençal mayonnaise) adds vibrancy.
5016293~This recipe was inspired by Aunt Gladys's beef, from Laurie Colwin (Gourmet, January 1992), and Nathalie Waag's leg of lamb with tomatoes and garlic (Gourmet, September 1986).
5016294~Also called sunchokes, Jerusalem artichokes are actually the roots of a variety of sunflower, but their sweet, nutty flavor is reminiscent of artichokes. What to drink: Unoaked Chardonnay from France (think Chablis) or New Zealand.
5016295~This salsa is delicious, easy, and versatile. I serve it with many grilled foods, including seafood, pork, and chicken. It's also excellent as a dip with tortilla chips. To preserve the salsa and prevent it from darkening, bury the avocado pits in it, cover tightly, and store in the refrigerator. It will keep for 3 to 4 days.

5016307~Team this dish with a mixed green salad for a delicious lunch.
5016308~This recipe was created to accompany Chilled Tarragon Tomato Soup with Vegatable Confetti .
5016309~The garnet yam, named for its dark reddish-brown skin, is the variety you're most likely to find in the produce section of the supermarket. It's actually a sweet potato, and it's so flavorful that it requires only a little cream and butter, and some tart lime juice.
5016310~If suave and hipster-hot is your idea of a dessert, you've just found it. These chile-ginger-mint jellies are an almost academic study in the contrasting sensations of hot and cool. The Chinese consider ginger to be hot—it's the source of heat in hot and sour soup—but Americans tend to view ginger more as a fresh, zinging accent of flavor. Add some fresh chile to the ginger and you introduce a new dimension of complexity that's counterbalanced by the cooling aspect of mint. The result? Your taste buds are rewarded with the dynamic duo of fiery hot and icy cold, all in one bite.
5016311~Tofu absorbs the richness of sesame oil and the tang of rice vinegar in a fresh salad that pops with crisp celery.

5016314~When a good ol' American candy bar veers French, it becomes a decadent dessert. Buttery pat-in-pan shortbread takes the place of mass-produced cookies and gets smothered with silken chocolate and from-scratch caramel, rich with fresh cream.
5016315~This is very easy to prepare and it makes an elegant addition to any party.

5016321~This recipe is from Cafe Annie in Houston, TX.
5016322~(Idlee Sambaar)
5016323~All that these steaks need is about 30 minutes in a very hot oven: no browning, no sauce, no fuss. Improv: Try the same seasonings on two whole chickens, a pork roast, or three racks of lamb.
5017962~Summery and light, this vivid salad and its tangy dressing help balance the tuna and its rich glaze. Salting the zucchini slices takes the edge off their rawness while preserving their pleasant snap.

5016326~Highly recommended!
5016327~If desired, garnish drinks with a wedge of grilled pineapple and a chile slice.
5017383~"Of all the ways to prepare shrimp, the grill delivers the best flavor. Although unadorned ""shrimp on the barbie"" are great, an easily assembled gingery barbecue sauce makes them that much better. You can save time by buying already shelled and deveined shrimp, but our recipe developer, Alexis Touchet, who grew up in shrimp country in southwest Louisiana, thinks shell-on shrimp are better quality. Depending on where you live and what's in your market, you may not have much choice. Freshness trumps all, so don't hesitate to use your nose in deciding which shrimp to buy."
5016329~Healthy bonus: Fiber, vitamin C, and potassium from bell peppers; lycopene from red pepper and ketchup (this recipe has less than half the sugar of the typical store-bought kind)

5016340~If you prefer, serve the short ribs for dinner with polenta, then use the leftovers to make a few sandwiches.
5016341~Bosc pears are distinguished by russet skins and elegantly elongated necks and stems. They are an ideal dessert pear because they hold their shape when roasted or poached. What to drink: Late-harvest Sauvignon Blanc.
5016342~Beer makes for a particularly crisp batter here, and the capers add piquancy. The broccoli and carrots work well in this recipe, but cooks might use other favorite vegetables too, adjusting the deep-frying time as necessary.
5016343~Classic salad, meet the open-face sandwich. Our version includes garlic-scented toast and a versatile, new-school egg salad made with cottage cheese, parsley, and capers.
5016344~Mint with lamb is a classic combination. Here, the mint is made into a gremolata, a garnish that is traditionally made with parsley and sprinkled over osso buco. And because spring is just around the corner, this long-cooked piece of meat is served with an assortment of baby veggies.
5016345~Highly recommended!
5016346~The flavor intensity of watercress can vary, so the amount needed for this soup will vary, too, depending on whether you like a strong or mild watercress taste.
5016347~For a cozy supper, accompany this quickly prepared dish with pumpernickel bread and hot mustard. Finish with a European-style dessert of cheese and fruit.
5016348~Savor raw oysters served with three spicy, slightly sweet, and fiery salsas.
5016349~Highly recommended!
5016350~To make these slow-cooked ribs, the barbecue is used like a smoker. The instructions given here are for a standard 22 1/2-inch Weber kettle barbecue. Grilling times and vent adjustments will vary with different brands of barbecues, and it may be necessary to cut the rib racks into four- or five-rib portions so that they’ll all fit on the grill. The only special equipment needed is a charcoal chimney, which is available at most home and garden stores and hardware stores.
5016351~Green Goddess Dressing is a perfect example of the magic of anchovies—they amplify and deepen the herbal flavors in this sauce without ever announcing their presence. For more recipes and tips, see our Homemade Salad Dressing Primer.
5016352~Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 1 3/4 hr (includes chilling time for syrup)
5016353~Highly recommended!
5016354~"Be sure to sample ""forest greens"" if you find them on a menu in Copenhagen—this term is not just a flight of fancy. The greens on offer there are pristine wild lettuces, herbs, and grasses growing in the mountains and on the forest floor. Since most of us don't have the opportunity to forage forest greens, we made this salad with a tangle of microgreens, which work nicely. The vinaigrette nods to the Scandinavian love for curry, but it truly plays up the flavors of the pork and potatoes as well, so feel free to drizzle it all over the plate."
5016355~Parisian chefs have been seduced by lemongrass. This riff on peppercorn sauce uses vermouth instead of the customary brandy to cut the richness of the steak.
5016356~Highly recommended!
5016357~In Egypt, eggplant was roasted over hot coals until the skin was charred. At home, I char the eggplant directly over the gas flame, turning frequently with tongs until the juices begin to ooze out. It can also be baked in a 425°F oven for 30 minutes.

5016367~Spatchcocking (or splitting and flattening) this Italian-influenced chicken before grilling helps it cook more quickly and evenly, creating the ultimate combo: Juicy meat and crispy skin. Carve and serve the whole chicken with Hobo Pack Potatoes with Rosemary and Garlic and save the breast for Summer Chef's Salad with Grilled Pork, Chicken, and Chimichurri Ranch Dressing.
5016368~The Banh Mi, arguably the greatest international sandwich, is easy to replicate at home. Letting the pickled radishes and carrots age a few days strengthens their tang and helps balance the rich pork.
5016369~You could bake this hunk of meat in an oven, but you'd be missing out on all that smoky flavor you'd be getting from the grill. Use this recipe for Bo Ssäm , Pork Banh Mi with Quick-Pickled Radishes and Carrots , and Summer Chef's Salad with Grilled Pork, Chicken, and Chimichurri Ranch Dressing , or just douse the meat with a little vinegar for a BBQ sandwich.
5017903~This standard diner salad may have petered out in the early '90s, but this version reminds us why it was popular in the first place. Smoky chicken and pork stand in for the typical drab turkey and ham, and the addition of herb-packed chimichurri dressing makes this salad fresh again.
5016371~These potatoes steam away in the coals while you grill the rest of your meal. If you're not eating them right away, keep them in their foil pouches and rewarm them on the grill or in a 350°F oven before serving.
5016372~For a complete diner-style meal, serve this indulgent main with sautéed green beans and buttermilk biscuits.

5016417~A sensational version of roast chicken that is great with rice.

5016437~To start, offer a seafood appetizer, such as chilled cocktail shrimp with herbed mayonnaise. What to drink: Pour Champagne or sparkling wine throughout the meal.
5016438~This elegant dessert was inspired by Vienna's Spanische Windtorte, a giant meringue shell filled with cream and berries. The sauce is a colorful and delicious accompaniment; if there is some left over, use it on pancakes, waffles or ice cream.
5016439~Meat loaf has been a favorite throughout the century, especially during the 1940s when meat was rationed and ground beef was a bargain cut. We’ve put a contemporary stamp on this suppertime classic by adding lots of caramelized onions.
5016440~Using a marinade like this one is a good way to add flavor and richness to food without adding too many calories. Serve the tuna with steamed rice, and offer Japanese beer or iced jasmine tea to drink.

5016447~"Posole is a thick, hearty stew typically containing corn and pork that originated in Jalisco, Mexico. Since I wanted to make this recipe vegetarian anyway, I decided to take it in an entirely new direction. The dried cherries may seem a little odd at first, but they lend a pleasant sweet-tartness to the dish while the pecans take it a bit deeper into the South. In the United States, we call the dried posole ""hominy."""
5016448~Haricots verts (small, thin French green beans) would also be nice as a side dish, but regular green beans would be fine, too.
5016449~Highly recommended!
5016450~This particularly enticing version of the holiday favorite includes fresh rosemary and thyme along with the spices. The nuts can be made several days in advance and stored in resealable plastic bags in a cool, dry place.
5016451~On the Cycladic islands, homemade salted pork flavors most vegetable dishes. Pancetta makes a good substitute here.
5016452~This variation on steak frites spices up the steak and gives a garlic boost to frozen fries. You can use any packaged spice-rub mix for beef, but we use a combination of equal parts cumin and coriander, half that amount of salt and pepper, and one eighth that amount of clove. If your rub doesn't contain salt, you'll need to add some, to taste. This take on a classic meal is easy, but you will be searing the steak and frying the potatoes at the same time.
5016453~This salad yields generous portions. Combined with a loaf of crusty bread, it’s easily a meal in itself.
5016454~Kimchi gives this porridge recipe a spicy twist, while the 6-minute egg keeps it hearty and perfect for breakfast.
5016455~This recipe originally accompanied Baja Fish Tacos .
5017415~Highly recommended!
5016457~This recipe is a fun alternative to the heavier dishes that tend to make an appearance at Super Bowl parties. A few variations can be made to this salad as well: Make it Buffalo style by tossing the chicken in a little hot sauce just after you've fried it. You can also vary the cheese (by using goat or Feta) and other salad ingredients (like lettuce type) according to taste.
5016940~For a double-crust pie, double the ingredients, divide the dough in half, and form two disks.
5016459~An elegant but easy first course. Frozen artichoke hearts are used for the filling, and purchased gyoza or wonton wrappers replace homemade pasta.
5016460~For a quick and satisfying after-work supper, team this tasty chicken dish with some cooked noodles that have been tossed with olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
5016461~When quickly cooked on the stove-top and then spooned onto baking sheets, this simple batter bakes into delicate lacy crisps.

5019170~Highly recommended!
5016468~In addition to the herb mayonnaise and blue cheese coleslaw, sliced tomatoes would be perfect alongside.
5016469~Quinoa is native to the Andes, not the Middle East, so it was unknown to the Jews fleeing Egypt during biblical times. With the recent rise of quinoa's popularity in the United States, and the fact that it's not a true grain but rather the seed of a broadleaf plant, some circles of Judaism have approved of and welcomed it to the Passover table, while others have not. If you feel comfortable serving it this Passover, you will love how it absorbs the vinaigrette, bright with lemon and enriched with finely grated hard-boiled eggs, and how it forms a tender bed for the ribbons of scallion and raw asparagus.
5016470~Purchase a roasted turkey leg or whole chicken at your market. This is also a great use for leftover turkey.
5016471~Haute ham and eggs! These appetizers are protein-rich, and cutting out the crust makes them incredibly low-cal.
5016472~Highly recommended!
5019844~Coconut milk is one of my favourite ingredients and it makes a fantastic creamy base for all the other robust flavours in this Asian-style soup. Choose firm sweet potatoes with orange flesh for their vibrant colour.

5016485~My editor, Peter Gethers, insisted on only one thing when he asked me to write this book: that I include the recipe for these pancakes. The ricotta causes them to burn more easily than other pancakes, so you need to cook them over medium-low to medium heat. If there are any pancakes that don't need maple syrup, these are them.

Blue cheese or crème fraîche offer sufficient tang for this salad if goat cheese is not available. If you are following our $68 Dinner Story, reserve the greens from the beets and the remaining Swiss chard stems and greens for the Sautéed Greens with Walnuts .

5016504~When we were children, shrimp dumplings were our favorite dim sum dish. The classic filling is shrimp and bamboo shoots. The dough is not difficult to make, but it is very important that the water be boiling hot. If it is not hot enough, the wheat starch will not cook and the dough will not work. Wheat starch _(dung fun)_is only available in Chinatown; regular white flour is not a substitute.
5016505~This is the stuffing of your dreams, in which everything is a little more rustic, rich, and intense than you remember.
5016506~Highly recommended!
5016507~No more dry bird! Goin prepares the breast and legs with distinct cooking techniques, resulting in unbelievable flavor and texture1 for each part: The breast is brined overnight before roasting, and the legs are cooked in duck fat and left to confit until fall-off-the-bone tender. Ask your butcher to remove the legs and thighs for you.
5016508~Highly recommended!
5016509~Highly recommended!
5016510~The combination of herbs, the rice noodles, and the garlicky lime sauce mark this pasta salad as Vietnamese.
5016511~Savoy cabbage would work well here, too.
5016512~Few travel experiences are more American than eating dessert at a roadside diner. My order? A slice of banana cream pie: the topping whipped high, the creamy filling offering comfort far from home. To elevate this classic in my own kitchen, I add sliced bananas to the hot (and simple) custard to infuse it with flavor. And did I mention chocolate's involved? It's my take on diner deluxe. —Janet Taylor McCracken
5016513~Highly recommended!
5016514~The creamy soup would be great with large sesame-coated breadsticks and a spinach salad with marinated mushrooms. Baked apples and oatmeal-raisin cookies are nice after. This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016515~Zucchini is a surprisingly chameleon-like vegetable—I find myself using it frozen in morning smoothies, pureed in desserts, and, now, grated in pizza crust! Zucchini pizza is a great way to sneak in extra servings of vegetables, and it is naturally lower in carbohydrates and higher in fiber compared with traditional crusts.
5016516~You'll have more spice rub than you need for the Grillades . Try this seasoning on fish, pork, or beef dishes.
5016517~"Home turf: California
Local flavor: In health-conscious California, chili is as likely to be made without meat as it is with it. No self-respecting Texan would sign off on chili with beans, squash, and bulgur—but this lean, mean dish is as delicious as it is healthful.
Make it a meal: continue the Cali fantasy with whole grain bread, an arugula salad with mushrooms and garlicky vinaigrette, and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (California, $8 per six-pack)."

5016521~These easy lamb chops are just right for a quick dinner. Pair them up with the mashed potatoes and some boiled green beans. Pour a full-bodied Merlot or Pinot Noir.
5016522~Chef Scott Boswell of Stella! in New Orleans keeps it simple: Sweet plum wedges are served with greens, goat cheese, and a bright vinaigrette.
5016523~This puckery, sparkling aperitif is booze-optional.
5016524~Parmigiano-Reggiano adds salty, nutty richness to this ratatouille, which rivals the best oven versions. To speed preparation, feel free to skip the first step of salting and rinsing the eggplant and zucchini (this process draws off any bitter juices). Instead, just remove any particularly seedy and brown parts of the eggplant, or use smaller Japanese eggplants (which also do not need to be peeled). For pizzazz, add chickpeas and pitted, chopped oil-cured black olives. To make this dish vegan, swap in olive oil for the butter and skip the cheese (adding olives will make up for cheese's saltiness).
5016525~Highly recommended!
5016526~Whether they feature shellfish, smoked fish or fresh fish, chowders are an essential part of New England cooking. Ours is prepared with a mixture of fresh cod, haddock and halibut, three important North Atlantic ocean varieties. We've made the surprising addition of butternut squash and kale--both popular regional vegetables--to this hearty soup for extra color and texture. Curry powder lends an unexpected bit of spice.
5016527~When I first heard about Ari Weinzweig's delicatessen in Ann Arbor, Michigan, I couldn't believe it. A deli in the home of my alma mater. It's not really a deli but more of an international food emporium like New York's Zabar's with a definite Jewish touch. Mr. Weinzweig, a drop-out Ph.D. candidate, has taken an academic and appetizing interest in updating Jewish recipes like mushroom and barley soup, going back in history to the nineteenth-century Eastern European version similar to that served at New York's Second Avenue Deli.
5016528~Pirão
5016529~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016530~This cake is a southern tradition for festive occasions. It can be completely assembled and chilled one day before serving.

5016534~Chill glasses in the freezer for 5–10 minutes to keep the ice cream from melting into the ginger beer too quickly.
5016535~A bit of cardamom gives this dessert its exotic flavor. The pudding needs to chill about five hours before serving, so be sure to plan ahead.
5016536~Highly recommended!
5016537~This fun, gooey treat makes a great after-school snack. The marshmallows are slightly charred and the bread is cleverly caramelized for double the toasty flavor.
5018974~Living in the Pacific Northwest, with our bounty of berries, tree-ripened fruits, hazelnuts, and wild mushrooms, makes going to the farmers' market feel like a season-long treasure hunt. I'm especially rewarded when I stop at the mushroom forager's stand and see a basket chock-full of chanterelle mushrooms. At the peak of the season, I buy fresh chanterelles and use them as often as I can, as in this golden-hued mushroom gravy accompaniment to the holiday bird.
5016539~The garlicky herb butter is similar to the butter served with escargots in southwestern France. IMPROV: When preparing the butter, try a shallot instead of garlic, and thyme instead of parsley.
5016540~Depending on the flavors and types of tea your kids like, feel free to experiment.

5016542~(PASTA CAPRESE)
5016543~A lovely dish that's a snap to prepare.
5016544~Fish stews abound throughout the Mediterranean and most evolved from the fishing boats themselves, as fishermen reserved the worst of their catch for themselves and cooked it on-board.
5017091~We use this dressing with our Onion-Crusted Fried Chicken Salad, but it's great, too, as a dip with pieces of fried chicken, vegetables, or best of all, with fried frogs' legs. It's a real thick dressing that gets even thicker when chilled.
5016546~For a long time it seemed to me that there was more than a superficial resemblance between the white Indian cheese called paneer and tofu. When I finally made the classic Indian dish of spinach and paneer using tofu, it tasted amazingly at home in the cumin, ginger, and chile-laced sauce. There's a little going back and forth between the skillet and a food processor, but this is an easy dish to make. I serve it over rice with a sprinkling of toasted black sesame seeds.
5016547~Highly recommended!
5016548~Christensen's vinegary, buttery, barely cooked greens stay bright in color and flavor.
5016549~Highly recommended!
5016550~Beets--both pickled and boiled--have long been a popular German side dish for meats. The sour cream dressing gets a kick from vinegar and mustard.
5016551~Crema — a Mexican cultured heavy cream similar to sour cream — is often drizzled over enchiladas and tostadas and added to side dishes and sauces. Here it lends a tangy balance to rich avocado and sweet corn.
5016552~Highly recommended!
5016553~This classic stuffing (or any of the stuffings here) is also good made with six cups of cubed cornbread in place of six cups of the pain rustique.
5016554~Weighing down the salmon fillet with heavy cans as it cures will press excess liquid out of the flesh to ensure a firm texture.
5016555~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5016567~You'll get about five cups of preserves from this recipe. Try leftovers alongside soft cheeses or over vanilla ice cream. Fresh ricotta is available at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Italian markets.
5016568~"""Common crackers,"" good-keeping hard wheat flour crackers akin to ship's biscuits or hardtack, were found in early New England households and often made their way into poultry dressings. In this recipe, we add leeks and large quantities of the kinds of herbs cultivated in Colonial kitchen gardens."
5016569~Even if you don't like anchovies, you've got to give this a try. First of all, you can't beat freshly steamed artichokes—nibbling the flesh from the little leaves, gobbling the tender heart. And the insanely good anchovy butter has absolutely no relation to the too-salty fish you may have had once at a takeout pizza joint. Instead, oil-packed anchovies contribute this subtle sea-salty punch that you just can't get from anything else.
5018491~The key to gratins is having all the ingredients—whether they're basic potatoes or the mixed root vegetables below—sliced the same thickness so they cook at the same rate. Make friends with a mandoline: It quickly yields precise, even slices.

5016576~Pilafs may be served at everyday meals but are grand enough for entertaining as well. If you like, you could add a generous pinch of saffron threads to the rice just before you cover it and let it simmer. You could also use chicken stock instead of the 22 cup water.
5016577~Highly recommended!
5016578~"""The Metropolitan Bakery in Philadelphia makes fabulous breads and other baked goods. My personal favorite is the carrot cake: It's moist and tender, and it's drizzled with a tart lemony icing,"" says John K. Wildemore IV of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ""I hope you can persuade the owner to share this recipe."""
5016579~Rice pilaf can be made traditionally, with basmati rice, or with regular long-grain white rice. For a real treat, garnish the pilaf with shredded coconut, raisins and chopped green onions.

5016583~This recipe is an accompaniment for Red-Cooked Pork with Frizzled Ginger.
5016584~The terms spring onions and green onions aren't synonymous, but the two vegetables are often interchangeable. Spring onions have a larger, rounder bulb end, and theyre slightly stronger in flavor. Look for them at farmers' markets and specialty foods stores.
5016585~In this sophisticated appetizer, the blinis are topped with American caviar, a delicious alternative to the pricey imported stuff.
5016586~Highly recommended!
5016587~Rosemary and peppercorns in the bouquet garni give an unexpected kick to this chilled dessert, which is elegant on its own or spooned over vanilla ice cream or yogurt.
5016588~If you prefer a smooth sauce, purée it in a blender. Serve with roasted potatoes and sautéed greens.
5016589~A country-style Italian bread and a hearty salad of romaine with roasted peppers and black olives would be great with this pasta dish. Pears with walnuts and Gorgonzola cheese would be a nice dessert.
5016590~Tosi has found a way to incorporate this sweet, savory, creamy component into many of her desserts. This recipe makes enough Milk Crumbs for either the cake or the cookies .

5016593~Think of the crunchy, granolaish sesame clusters as seedy croutons for this juicy and bracing salad.
5016594~France's classic flourless chocolate cake is a perennial favorite on dessert lists. Ours has a trendy tropical garnish of mango and crystallized ginger and is served warm.
5016595~An impressive but easy dessert that's like a custard with fruit baked in it. In the summertime, make it with fresh peaches or plums instead of the pears.
5016596~Any leftovers would be great for breakfast.
5016597~Lime and grapefruit juices enhance the creamy white-chocolate filling in this treat.
5016598~Dried cracked corn, after being soaked and cooked, is mixed with milk and brown sugar to make a soupy sweet for indigenous peoples in the highlands of Colombia. Here it adds the thickening base that potatoes would in a traditional chowder. Chipotle and bacon mingle to form a low, smoky whisper of heat.
5016599~The Shakers, who once had a number of active communities in New England, were known for their creative use of fresh herbs in cooking and baking. This savory yeast bread is a typical example. It is delicious freshly baked or toasted the following day.

5016604~Caramelized onions and chopped red bell pepper add subtle sweetness to this lightly spiced side dish.
5016605~You only need 2 tablespoons of this paste for the Panang Vegetable Curry. Freeze tablespoonfuls of the remaining paste on a sheet pan, then store in a plastic freezer bag for up to 2 months. Use cubes to add deep flavor to soups, stews, and rice dishes.

5016620~Nothing beats a good old-fashioned roast chicken with all the trimmings. Fresh herbs, crispy bacon, potatoes, sausages and a great gravy all add up to the kind of dish that creates nostalgia. Steamed baby carrots and sautéed shredded cabbage are proper accompaniments.

5016633~If you've been looking for a chocolate sugar cookie that doesn't wimp out, delivering the dark chocolate hit you crave, this is the one for you. The thin coating of melted bittersweet chocolate, along with a festive sprinkle of crushed candy canes, only enhances the depth of flavor inherent in the cookie's deep brown color.

5016635~Pescado Zarandeado
5016636~Since the fruit is tart and acidic, the taste for sour cherries right off the tree is an acquired one. When tamed with sweeteners, like sugar or honey, this fruit becomes a natural for liqueurs, preserves, and syrups.
5016637~All of the components of this healthful one-dish dinner are roasted in the same skillet: The rice goes in first, then the salmon and broccolini. And they're all flavored with a lime, honey, and cilantro sauce. If desired, serve with lime wedges to squeeze over.

5016643~"""For as long as I can remember, every Christmas Eve I've hosted an open house with a Mexican buffet,"" writes Jill Cole of Fallbrook, California. ""Any suggestion of varying the meal is met with cries of protest from family and friends. I set out guacamole, salsa, homemade tamales, and what has become my famous albóndigas soup."""
5016644~This recipe originally accompanied Strawberry Basket Cake .
5016645~A blintz is simply a filled crepe. If making crepes is new to you, you'll be glad to know that there is plenty of batter to try a few practice ones. The completed blintzes can be frozen for up to a month.
5016646~We were surprised at how many different varieties of gorgeous red lettuces and red greens we were able to find to create this visually stunning salad. Tossed with a simple vinaigrette, it is a lovely counterpoint to the richness of the meat and potatoes.
5016647~Be patient with these; they need to stay over indirect heat the whole time to minimize flare-ups. If you try to rush them, they’ll burn to a crisp.
5016648~Highly recommended!
5016649~Highly recommended!

5016656~Since the crust is made with purchased puff pastry, this delightful savory tart comes together easily.
5016657~This ice cream doesn't hit you over the head with the flavor of chestnuts. Mellow and creamy, it's great on its own — though when we're not having it with the Tarte Tatin, we like to serve it with a delicate butter cookie.
5016658~Highly recommended!
5016659~This is a great frosting for the Carrot Cake . The lemon zest complements the cream cheese so perfectly that I sometimes even snack on this frosting—I just can't get enough of the sweet, tangy flavor! If you want extra oomph on the Carrot Cake, add minced ginger to the lemon zest.
5016660~The roasting juices from the goose and balsamic vinegar make a lively sauce to accompany the rich meat.

5019515~In this rich, sweet salad, we've included not just onions but their relatives in the Allium family — shallots, leeks, garlic, and chives. For meltingly tender results, be sure to peel off the papery outer layer, the leathery second layer, and any paper-thin membranes from the onions, shallots, and leeks.
5016672~"This is an early signature dish of my colleague Jonathan Waxman, who has been at the center of the contemporary American food scene since the early 1970s, when he worked at Chez Panisse in Berkeley and at Michael's in Los Angeles. Waxman now presides over Barbuto—he's ""the bearded one""—in the far west Greenwich Village, where all- American inclinations meet simple Italian cooking, frequently in the wood- burning oven. Jonathan's cooking has always been defined by its clarity; there are times when I wonder how he has managed to make something as simple as a roasted chicken or a plate of beets seem so special. Top-quality ingredients in season and vigilant preparations are the answers—what I strive for in my own cooking. This dish is a classic example of the early wave of what was known as the New American Cooking—a movement, if not a revolution, now forty years old and counting. It also demonstrates that a new, even trendy, dish can endure and become a classic—if it has integrity. Nevertheless, you can improvise here. Change the herbs according to what you've got, and the oils for the dressing."
5016673~Strong beef broth and garlic, not sugar, make a true Ukrainian borscht delicious. Fresh root vegetables and roasted beets provide plenty of sweetness which is balanced by an acid edge of lemon.
5016674~Highly recommended!
5016675~Traditionally, the garlic and ginger in the marinade are minced, but Grace Young finds it easier to use a rasp grater.
5016676~For best results, make this stuffing with day-old Buttermilk Corn Bread.
5016677~Silky and sweet, these onions add a sophisticated touch to adults' burgers (adventurous younger eaters will enjoy them, too).
5016678~Finally, PB&J for dessert. In this whimsical sweet, a peanut butter shortbread cookie is topped with a layer of blackberry jam. Some frozen shortbread dough is grated over the jam before baking for a nice finishing touch.
5016679~Serve this with white rice for a dinnertime side dish or alongside ham and eggs for a satisfying breakfast.
5016680~In the recipe below it is not necessary to soak the pasta squares because they are not cut or rolled.

5016684~The problem with Franco-American food trends, like the current one with macarons—those pastel puffs of sweet air that seem to be everywhere—is that its good ol' American predecessor, the macaroon, gets forgotten. The truth is, though, we never stopped loving the coconut macaroon. In fact, we craved its dense, moist chew. Retrofit the macaroon as a bite-size sandwich filled with a pucker-worthy tart lime curd, and you've caught a new trend headed straight for the stars.
5016685~Serve this appetizer with crusty bread and enjoy.

5016692~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5016693~Bulgogi (grilled marinated beef) is a traditional Korean dish. Here, lamb stands in for the steak. The meat is served with lettuce leaves and other veggies, hot pepper paste, and a slightly sweet dipping sauce. Guests use all of the ingredients to assemble their own lettuce wraps, which is a common practice in Korean restaurants. Timing note: The lamb needs to marinate for at least four hours.
5016694~Why do I love roast winter vegetables? For starters, because they are fresh, local, and seasonal. Unlike summer produce, they keep for a long time without losing most of their flavor. They feel like winter food: hearty, substantial, rib-sticking. Francis Mallmann quick-roasts them at very high heat in a wood oven until they almost burn. A home oven doesn't put out that kind of thousand-degree heat, but when something as simple as slices of Delicata squash are coated with a little bit of olive oil, sprinkled with kosher or coarse sea salt, and then roasted, they come out of the oven chewy, nutty, sweet, and savory. Part caramelization, part umami, and part Maillard.
5016695~The Original: Breaded, fried eggplant with a thick oregano-flavored tomato sauce. Our Version: Broiled slices of eggplant wrapped around a mint-and chard-flecked ricotta filling.

5016699~Majorcans love to talk about the quality of their vegetables, and this dish of sautéd eggplant, potatoes and bell peppers in fresh tomato sauce, called tumbet, is one of their favorite creations. We suggest serving it with grilled fish or lamb chops, as Majorcans do.
5016700~Layers and layers of thin, tender whole-wheat crêpes and smoked salmon make a stunning multilayered cake-like torte. To serve, cut into small wedges for an appetizer or into slightly larger wedges to accompany a salad.

5016702~"I open the braising chapter with one of Italy's most renowned braises: osso buco. It's a classic Milanese dish usually made with veal shanks cooked in a rich broth that includes tomato and wine. I salt the meat before cooking it, a technique that tenderizes the veal. The dish is finished with lemon zest and parsley, which stand in for the more common gremolata that often accompanies it, along with saffron risotto. The term ossobuco roughly translates to ""hole in the bone"" or ""pierced bone."" I suggest you tie the shanks before cooking them so that they hold together—and don't forget to dig into the bones for the luscious bone marrow."
5016703~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5016704~Though these bruschetta are a terrific first course for almost any meal. They'd actually make a great lunch as well—just think of them as open-faced sandwiches.
5016705~This cheese course is one I frequently serve to guests at home, and every time it's enthusiastically received. Asiago is a little softer than aged Parm, with a nutty, sweet flavor that is gorgeous with glazed onions. I also find it's a fantastico red wine cheese, and goes quite nicely with a dessert Sauternes.
5016706~Louis Osteen makes his mayonnaise fresh, but we've substituted bottled mayonnaise to avoid raw egg yolks.
5016707~Highly recommended!
5016708~To pit the olives easily, just press them with the flat side of a knife until the meat separates from the center.

5016710~It's best to divide this salad between two bowls; put one on the buffet table, and keep the other refrigerated until you need it later in the party. Make the pickled onions at least one day ahead.
5016711~We love this recipe as much for the soy-glazed bonito flakes, with their maddeningly good smoky-savory-sweet flavor, as for making such great use of leftovers.

5016717~The trick to french fries is double-frying. First, flash-fry the potatoes to eliminate moisture, then fry them again to ensure crispness. Eating them with mayonnaise will take you to Europe.
5016718~Mullen serves these robustly flavored meatballs as a shared plate at El Colmado, his New York City tapas bar, but they're also a great main.
5018042~Highly recommended!
5016720~This dish, flavored with achiote seeds, garlic, and spices, is based on chicken pibil, from Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Traditionally, the chicken is baked in banana leaves, but here we've used collard leaves because they are more readily available. They add moisture and a bit of flavor but do not get tender enough to eat.
5016721~This recipe takes its cues from Spain's classic fried pork and from an Italian favorite - the combination of pork and fennel.
5016722~Highly recommended!
5016723~It can be hard to gauge what's happening under all that salt, but these times are accurate. If your fish is on the smaller side, take it out on the lower end of the range.

5016725~Onions are loaded with umami flavor, as are anchovies, mushrooms, and Worcestershire sauce. Together, they make this dip especially hard to resist.

5016729~If you've made another recipe that called for Garlic Mayonnaise and happen to have some left over in the refrigerator, a dollop of it on the plate makes a delicious addition to this hearty, rustic dish.
5016730~This sauce, inspired by Spanish romesco, uses cherry tomatoes, which are usually the best-tasting type in the market this time of year.
5016731~A leek puree adds rich flavor. This side dish is especially good with the Brisket with Dried Apricots, Prunes, and Aromatic Spices recipe.
5016732~Begin this at least one day ahead. Serve with Potato-Leek Matzo Balls and steamed asparagus. What to drink: A full-bodied red with robust fruit, such as Zinfandel or Australian Shiraz.
5016733~This fragrant dish has a wonderful blend of spices and goes well with steamed basmati rice.
5016734~This rich buttery dough works as a great gluten-free alternative to classic sugar cookie dough, as well as pie, tart, and bar-cookie crusts. The oat flour gives it a hint of nutty flavor, while the cream cheese lends body and makes it easy to roll out.

5016736~Highly recommended!
5016737~Street vendors throughout Mexico's beach towns sell cold fresh fruit served in a plastic bag with bits of ice in it to keep the fruit chilled. This dessert is as take on that, as well as a refreshing end to any meal. Feel free to experiment by pouring a bit of tequila over the ice to create an instant margarita.
5020005~No Thanksgiving dinner would be complete without cranberry relish. It can be made in large batches if you want to make enough for the winter.
5016739~"""When I lived in South Africa, rum and raisin chocolate bars were a special treat,"" says Beth Peterson of Phoenix, Arizona. ""I created this brownie recipe based on that combination of flavors, and perfected it with the help of friends and colleagues who sampled the brownies at each stage of development. These have a grown-up taste with the right balance of sweetness and rum."""

5016741~Star anise, cinnamon, and apple cider give this dish the flavors of fall. Add some wilted greens and a nice Zinfandel, and you've got a sophisticated dinner party.
5016742~By cooking the rice and toasting the walnuts ahead, you can take this dish from skillet to table in a very short time.
5016743~Simply pour this rich dressing over wedges of crisp iceberg lettuce or quartered heads of romaine for a salad, or use it as a dip for crudités.
5016744~The chicken and vegetables are strained out for a clear soup. If you'd like, save some chicken and vegetables to serve along with the matzo balls in the soup.
5016745~This hearty dish averages about $2 per serving. It's ideal for breakfast or brunch (accompanied by a salad).
5016746~Many years ago, I worked with a cook who introduced me to this method of roasting pork with milk and fresh orange. Jose has long since retired to his little pueblo in Michoacan, but his recipe lives on in my kitchen simply because it so delicious. Pork cooked this way is moist and succulent, sweet from the natural caramelization of the milk, with the slightest hint of orange and black pepper. For an over-the-top garnish, crumble chicharrón (fried pork skin) on the soft roast meat for a porky, crunchy textural contrast. Serve the carnitas with warm corn tortillas, avocado, a crisp raw tomatillo salsa, and plenty of onions and cilantro. If you have access to heirloom pork such as Kurobuta or Berkshire, it's exceptionally delicious—pork the way pork was meant to taste.
5016747~Highly recommended!
5016748~Rettichsalat
5016749~For the best flavor, marinate the chicken overnight. If you're short of time, use a 15-ounce can of cannellini or lima beans instead of the dried beans. With this rich, garlicky sauce, you need only a fresh salad to complete the meal.
5016750~This one honors our longtime barbecue buddy, the late Bob Carruthers, of New South Wales. We met Bob during his first trip to Lynchburg, Tennessee, to serve as an international judge at the Jack Daniel's World Championship Invitational Barbecue. From then on he played a significant role in introducing Australian barbecue to Americans and American barbecue to Australians. His footprints on The Jack will endure, as will many good memories of the fun and enthusiasm he brought to the event. For this one we recommend Australian lamb ribs, and the whiskey has to be Jack Daniel's. Life is sweet. Life is sour. Life goes on.
5016751~A flavorful filling in an elegant dessert.

5016756~When you put okra and cornmeal—two icons of the southern table—together in a hot greased skillet, magic happens, especially when you've tossed in a little crisp bacon for good measure.

5016770~This refreshing cocktail can be a dessert, but it is also a great brunch drink. In Italy, Lucia likes to use Italian sparkling wine (such as spumante) instead of Champagne.
5018540~This is a great way to use up leftover roasted vegetables and chicken and turn them into a light salad. The roasted veggies are more interesting the second time around in a vinaigrette as opposed to just on their own. Even when I don't have leftover roasted veggies, I have been known to toss some raw ones in the oven just to make this delicious dressing, which I eat on everything: pasta, grilled fish, and, obviously, chicken. The chicken for this salad can be warm or cold, straight from the fridge.

5016804~Baked tofu is crispy on the outside, creamy inside, and loaded with flavor. Removing as much water as possible from the tofu before cooking it, as in this recipe, helps the tofu absorb the flavors of the marinade and cook up crisp rather than mushy. It is delicious eaten as is or in sandwiches, salads, or stir-fries. Serve hot or cold.

5016809~This dish originates from Bizerte, the northernmost city in Africa. It is sweet and spicy and beautifully aromatic. It is adapted from a recipe kindly given to us by Rafram Hadad.

5016812~Naturally sweet, fresh figs get an all-over taste treatment with tangy goat cheese, smoky pancetta, slightly bitter fruit liqueur, and heat from black pepper. Serve these figs as finger-food appetizers or place them on top of dressed greens for a salad. High-heat planking caramelizes the figs and burnishes the goat cheese, adding another level of flavor. The high heat cooks the fruit quickly, resulting in an outer charred fruit and warm center that has texture and bite but is not mushy. This is an excellent way to plank most fruits and vegetables. Keep a spray bottle of water handy to lightly douse flare-ups.
5016813~This easy dressing makes a great side dish for roast chicken or fried pork chops.

5016844~This is one of the real classics of [Friuli-Venezia Giulia] cuisine. You will find it wherever you travel, especially in springtime when wild herbs sprout in fragrant profusion all over la terra fortunata. The key here is to use as large a variety of herbs, grasses, and greens as you can locate. It is traditional that there be at least five different types. Among the most famous are silene, hops, melissa, mint, verbena, basil, marjoram, sage, parsley, spinach (just a little), fennel leaves, Swiss chard, zucchini (courgette) flowers, wild fennel, beet greens, chervil, sorrel, and celery leaves. This frittata is served piping hot, tepid, or cold. As always, it should be covered if allowed to cool, and cut into wedges before serving.

5016851~This salad highlights the many green herbs that are an essential part of Persian cuisine, especially in spring when they are just coming into season.

5016859~Orange juice and pomegranate juice enhance the light sorbet. The compote would also be good over store-bought strawberry sorbet or ice cream.

5016862~This is the definition of minimalist Thai cooking. The steam not only gently cooks the fish until just tender but also creates an instant, complex sauce from a handful of basic ingredients.

But good food is important to me, especially since I need a lot of energy to stay on the go. So over the years, I've started experimenting in the kitchen. Now the other members of my improv group even like to come to my 'wrap parties' to taste my creations."""
5016877~Crisp chayote goes by a raft of different names, but its Brazilian one, xuxu, was the inspiration for this quick stir-fry. The dish's vivid good looks echo its primal shout of flavor. After the shrimp, xuxu, and hearts of palm are cooked, they're tossed with a raw sauce of garlic, onion, jalapeño, and lots of lemon juice, which keeps everything sparkling and very fresh-tasting.
5016878~From the Temple House in Ballymote, Ireland.
5016879~Giving foods that glorious crispy- crunchy texture without a deep fryer isn't easy. The best way to healthfully approximate the deep- fried experience is to use panko breadcrumbs, a mist of cooking spray, and a hot oven. Panko is a Japanese ingredient that used to be found only in Asian supermarkets and health- food stores but is now available everywhere. The crumbs are made from crustless bread, so they're lighter and crunchier than traditional breadcrumbs.

I mean, what could be less interesting than cold boiled shrimp dipped in a lackluster mixture of ketchup and prepared horseradish? Here's a shrimp cocktail with gumption, featuring chile-rubbed, grill-seared shrimp served over a colorful, chunky salsa of avocado and sweet corn. You can chill the grilled shrimp before you serve them, but I like the contrast of hot shrimp and cool salsa.

5016901~"""Simple, simple, simple! Just throw it in the oven and jump in the shower."" That's how food stylist Toni Brogan described this savory pie, a favorite in her native New Zealand. And it really is that easy—just line a pan with puff pastry, fill it up with onions, thinly sliced potatoes, and, in place of the usual bacon, prosciutto (left over from Ravioli with Green Beans and Prosciutto ), then crack some eggs on top and cover with more pastry. By the time everyone is out of the shower, the pie is ready to come out of the oven, all golden and flaky on the outside, layered with deliciousness on the inside. Though it's traditional to serve the pie with ketchup, we love it with some spicy chutney on the side."
5016902~We won't dispute that Guillaume Sorrieu's bouillabaisse, from L'Épuisette, in Marseille, is the best of the best, but where does that leave the home cook with no access to fresh seafood from the Mediterranean? The trick is to look for the freshest local fish you can find and not to be afraid of improvising. That's what we've done here (forget serving the dish in two courses). The fish remains firm, the broth clear, the flavor sublime.

5016914~The truffle oil is not essential, but it's a nice indulgent touch. Since the oil's flavor dissipates with heat, add the oil to this first-course soup just before serving.

5016921~Serve this curry with condiments such as dried currants, sliced green onions, shredded coconut and toasted slivered almonds.
5016922~If you have trouble finding pea tendrils, pea sprouts (young pea tendrils) work very well with this dish; you'll find them at Asian markets and farmers' markets.
5016923~Highly recommended!
5016924~"On one of my first trips to India, at a bus stop in Poona, there was a street stand where the vendor was roasting potatoes over charcoal, chopping them, and tossing them with curry spices and crispy onions. He served the mixture wrapped in a piece of newspaper. It was amazing, and it inspired this dish.
There are so many curry spice mixtures from around the world. This recipe employs one of the most common. You can use either yams or sweet potatoes in this recipe."

5016938~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5019340~To make this fresh American rendition of panzanella (the Italian bread-and-tomato salad), bake the cornbread one day ahead so that it will be firm enough to toast on the grill.

5016943~Real fruit instead of sugary juices or mixes cuts the cals in this sparkling sip. Tastes better, too.
5016944~This sauce can be prepared with yellow bell peppers instead of poblano chiles. Both sauces go equally well with the chicken-and they also complement each other nicely. So follow your mood: earthy poblano or sunny, sweet yellow bell pepper-or make half a recipe of each and serve them both.
5016945~Sage is to turkey what cinnamon is to apples; they go together like bread and butter. The seasoned butter on this bird is a bright and herbal mix of chopped sage leaves and fresh orange and lemon zest, which bathes the breast with the essence of the Thanksgiving aroma.
5016946~The Potato Gratin with Cream and Fresh Herbs is a nice accompaniment to this main course. And for the wine, consider serving a flavorful red, such as a Pinot Noir from Oregon.

5016955~Radicchio's bitterness is a nice match for the slightly sweet sausages. Serve this hearty dish with crusty bread or with pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic, and chopped Italian parsley.

5016962~Baker's sugar, a favorite of pastry chefs, is also called superfine sugar. It measures the same as regular but dissolves more quickly. It's available at some supermarkets. You can also make your own by whizzing granulated sugar in a food processor until powdery.

5016972~Turmeric gives this rice its vivid color.
5016973~This is as delicious with mussels as it is with clams. Offer a simple green salad afterward, and pears and a wedge of Italian cheese for dessert.
5016974~Any kind of mild honey will work beautifully here. It will cook into a rich caramel, which coats the peaches and deepens their sweetness.
5016975~Highly recommended!
5016976~Watercress is the green of choice in Cuba, its peppery taste a perfect foil for the avocado and the sweet pineapple in this classic Cuban salad. I serve it with shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce called enchilado de camarones. In Cuba, the pineapple is never roasted, but this technique adds another dimension of flavor I find very appealing.
5016977~Sweet sausage will workin this springtime risotto, too; the final result just won't taste spicy.
5016978~For these ultra-chewy and tender cookies, I started with the traditional chocolate chip cookie, took out some sugar and half the butter (but left enough to keep it delicious!), swapped the flours, and added oats and shredded coconut, which toast and caramelize to give the cookies an extra chewy texture.
5016979~The combination of sweet and savory from pears and sausage is just what you want to take the chill off an autumn evening.
5016980~This is one of my favorite recipes in this book, mainly because of the fun evening I had developing it while visiting my dear friend Kevyn in New York City. I prepared it in his kitchen while he and our mutual friend Jennifer looked on, sipping wine. We enjoyed the meal with a bottle of Côtes du Rhône wine and then, with dessert, drank port left over from the recipe. This is one of the most elegant dishes in the book, and while it's by no means difficult to prepare, it's an indulgent recipe that is ideal for a special occasion or a dinner party.—JH
5016981~This recipe serves 4 as a main course after you set aside one third of the fish (see cooks' note, below) to make the capellini with salmon and lemon-dill-vodka sauce. Otherwise, it serves 6.

5016983~Here's a tropical chicken dish from cookbook author Daisy Martinez.
5016984~Steaming, a method often used by Asian cooks, works well with delicately flavored red snapper, since the aromatics (ginger, scallion, chile) are easily absorbed by the fish.

5016987~Highly recommended!
5016988~The fresh flavors and crisp textures in this salsa complement the tender sea bass.
5016989~Simple savory tarts abound in Provence. A particular favorite includes slow-cooked onions, mellow and nearly as sweet as marmalade, punctuated with hints of the herbs that grow wild all over the region—in this case, fennel. Cooks are known to vary their crusts depending on the affair, from short, buttery versions to pizzalike yeast crusts; the latter is used here to keep the tart light.
5016990~Halved cherry tomatoes and diced green chilies make a chunky relish for the tri-tip.

5016999~When buying the dried chile for this recipe, be aware that a pasilla de Oaxaca is not the same as a regular pasilla chile. The former is smoked and has a very distinct flavor.
5017000~Highly recommended!
5017001~Even in its simplicity, there's something about this buttery almond cake that just feels special. Baking it in a pie dish allows for you to serve it straight out of the vessel, whether for breakfast or a mid-afternoon snack, accompanied by nothing but a steaming cup of coffee or tea.
5017002~Highly recommended!
5017003~Don't be intimidated by the amount of hot pepper sauce in the marinade; the chicken will pick up only some of the heat.

5017016~This spin on onigiri, Japanese sticky white rice balls, combines the earthiness of brown rice and mushrooms with the crunch of a sesame seed crust. The key is cooking the rice until it releases all of its starch, then chilling it in the fridge so you can easily roll it into balls before baking.

5017022~My mother always made wonderful side dishes — and made them look so easy. Indeed, they were! A few fresh vegetables, great herbs, a little mustard or vinegar, and kosher salt were all it took for her to make something taste like it came right from the garden. Here's her incredibly simple recipe for coleslaw — a step removed from traditional recipes that are typically bland and smothered in mayonnaise, this slaw is sharp and crunchy and great with salads, roast meats, and sandwiches.
5017023~When I put these ingredients in my rice cooker, I knew the flavors would complement each other, but I wondered what the dish would look like. It was lovely! The soft, melting goat cheese mingled with the asparagus and creamy eggs. The frittata makes a great light supper or lunch dish; serve it with a fruit salad.
5017024~Highly recommended!
5017025~What makes classic peanut butter filling in chocolate cups irresistible is the edge of salt against sweet. That and a texture that hovers between creamy and crumbly. To get more peanutty goodness—and a tastier homemade version of it—blitz up peanuts, sugar, and salt and stuff it into a huge tart pan lined with chocolate. It's as addictive as the original with a freshness from just-ground peanuts.
5017026~Highly recommended!
5017027~In most of France, turkey with chestnuts has become a standard Christmas dish, but in the southwest, goose is preferred.
5017028~Orzo with lemon zest and Italian parsley would be lovely alongside. What to drink: Viognier or French Chardonnay.

5017030~Highly recommended!
5017031~Highly recommended!
5017032~The beauty of this basic recipe is that it can be tweaked in numerous ways. For a spicy version, add some sriracha sauce. Try swapping out the lemon juice for lime juice and use feta cheese instead of Parmesan and mix in some chopped fresh cilantro and chopped red onion or shallot. For a curried chickpea salad, leave out the Parmesan and add curry powder to taste, dried currants, sliced green onions, and shredded carrots.

5017034~"""My husband and I just returned from a trip to Italy,"" writes Kim Riemann of North Brunswick, New Jersey. ""Of all the great meals we had there, a few stand out in my memory. One was at Buca Mario in Florence. The rosemary-scented bean soup was unforgettable."""
5017035~This starter gets a double dose of cayenne — in the cornmeal coating for the shrimp and in the garlicky mayonnaise dip.
5017036~Crispy, salty, creamy, and full of protein (really!), these chickpeas should be a staple in your kitchen.
5018447~Highly recommended!
5017038~Pass a pitcher of cold low-fat or nonfat milk to drizzle over this cereal.

5017048~Skirt steak, which is full of flavor and holds marinades well, is the essential beef cut for fajitas.
5017049~Start with a large platter.
5017050~This smoky, creamy combination of white and sweet potatoes may be the ultimate Thanksgiving side dish.
5017051~Everyone should know how to roast a chicken. It's a life skill that should be taught to small children at school. The ability to properly prepare a moist yet thoroughly cooked bird, with nicely crisp skin, should be a hallmark of good citizenry—an obligation to your fellow man. Everyone walking down the street should be reasonably confident that the random person next to them is prepared, if called upon, to roast a chicken.
5017052~Unlike their big brothers, baby artichokes are almost completely edible and require minimal preparation. For this first course, sautéing the artichokes instead of steaming adds good flavor. Some people don't like to have artichokes with wine because they can make the wine taste either metallic or strangely sweet. In Italy, though, artichokes and wine are usually served together. A crisp, steely Pinot Grigio does the trick.

5017073~Inspired by croquettes, these brightly spiced fish cakes will transport you to sunnier shores. The recipe takes advantage of the large flake and meatiness of hake to give crab cakes a run for their money.
5017074~Scallops are rich in iodine, essential to a healthy thyroid and metabolism.
5017075~Want to feel alert and energized? Repeat after us: protein, protein, protein. Here's a way to get lots of it, with very little saturated fat. (For an equally high-energy vegetarian version of this dish, substitute 12 ounces firm tofu, drained and cut in 1-inch cubes, for the shrimp.)

5017085~A great brunch treat.
5017086~Harissa is a great shortcut ingredient to flavor, but no two jars (or tubes) are the same. Taste first—if it seems very spicy, use a bit less. You can always stir more into the chickpeas when the dish is finished.
5017087~If Cabrales is difficult to find in your area, it can be ordered on-line from tienda.com. Italian Gorgonzola can also be substituted. Serve the onions and the Roasted Red Peppers with Garlic with plenty of crusty bread. What to drink: Albariño. This fragrant Spanish white varietal is a smooth match with the starters and the red snapper baked in salt.
5017088~The low-fat mushroom ragout can also be served over toast points or as a side dish.
5017089~Highly recommended!
5017090~Offer some homemade breadsticks with the lamb: Just cut a French bread baguette lengthwise into quarters; brush with olive oil that has been mixed with fresh herbs. Grill alongside the lamb until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Serve raspberries and cream with cookies for dessert.
5017091~When I was a single gal in NYC and my parents lived in Westchester, we used to meet almost halfway for dinner at Gus's in Harrison, new york. It is a great bar serving delicious seafood and their salad was my favorite—red wine vinaigrette with big hunks of blue cheese. We were always a blue cheese—loving family and my version, with a creamy base (can't compete with Gus!), is fantastic on a wedge of iceberg lettuce or as a dip. It lasts for a good week in the fridge as well.
5017092~Transporting this dish is easy: Stack the fillet slices together and wrap them in plastic wrap; pack the arugula, onions, beans, and dressing in separate containers. Then toss everything together just before serving.
5017093~This is one of my everyday vinaigrettes. The wood aging of the sherry vinegar creates a wonderfully complex flavor that is enhanced by the walnut oil. Sherry vinegar is a little more expensive than red wine vinegar, but it has a higher acidity so you use less. Pair this dressing with strongly flavored salad greens, cheeses, nuts, and seasonal fruits, like in my Seasonal Country Salad.
5017094~With their golden flesh and creamy texture, Baby Dutch Yellow and Yellow Finn potatoes are preferred here.

5017098~A spicy arugula and tomato salad accompaniment makes this a perfect light summer entrée that could easily serve as a one-dish meal, or a piatto unico as they are known in Italy. The trick is to cook the chops slowly over even, meduim heat, so that they cook through without burning the bread-crumb crust.
5017099~Highly recommended!
5017100~Cooking these flatbreads in a grill pan gives them a smoky flavor. They can be served with hummus or the Lebanese Lamb and Bean Stew. Don't expect a pocket — they are like rustic tortillas.
5017101~Serve with: Warm corn tortillas, Spanish rice, and grilled zucchini. Dessert: Fresh coconut cake from the bakery.

5017105~Inspired by chef Robert Del Grande of Cafe Annie, in Houston, we combine the succulence of short ribs with the bitter undertones of coffee and the mellow heat of two kinds of chiles, along with maple syrup and lime juice to cut the spiciness. We recommend serving these meltingly tender ribs over soft polenta.
5017106~"There are two hits of chile in this dish. It's used early on to infuse the oil, where it mellows. The sprinkle added at the end is more ""precocious,"" says Krajeck. ""It's not in every bite, but when it hits you, it makes a big impact."""
5017107~The fried olives used to garnish this colorful salad just might become your new favorite. Try scattered over crostini or salads.
5017108~Along with a classic vinaigrette made with sherry vinegar and red-wine vinegar, this is an all-purpose dressing I turn to time and again.

5017144~Giving up fried shrimp is probably easier than giving up, say, chocolate cake, but only because so much fried shrimp is so badly prepared. Here is a terrific version, complete with tartar sauce for dipping.
5017145~Puttanesca is usually a pasta sauce, but here the addition of beans to the spicy blend of tomatoes, basil, and olives turns it into a versatile, satisfying side dish.
5017146~Everything is approximate with brisket and tzimmes, since some people can't stand prunes and others want nothing but. The amounts listed below are estimates; feel free to change them. Though Karen Stabiner calls for first-cut brisket, which is relatively lean, we prefer the more evenly marbled second cut for moister, more succulent meat.
5017147~Charoset, a traditional Passover condiment, represents the mortar used by Israelite slaves in Egypt. In this contemporary Mexican version, bananas and other fruit are puréed and cooked down to a sweet spread.

5017152~"If it's melon season, you have to make this. In Burma (Myanmar), gin thoke, meaning ""ginger mix,"" is a blend of crispy fried garlic, sesame seeds, and ginger, and is eaten as a sweet digestive snack after meals. Although not native to the region, melons are a refreshing and delicious complement to this dressing, together making a perfect summertime side dish. The ginger is key to this salad. Ideally, the gingerroot should be so young that the skin is almost transparent and the roots are tipped with pink."
5017153~In the past two years, half of our food editors have traveled to Spain, where they tried a variety of croquetas (ham, fish, and vegetable) that left a very positive impression. Serve these potato croquetas with any combination of dried sausage, olives, nuts, and cheese.

5017156~To begin, fill a platter with slices of bresaola and mozzarella, and also serve a warm salad of roasted peppers. The spinach, basil and ricotta puree and orzo with lemon peel are terrific with the chicken, as is a dry white wine like a Greco di Tufo. Dessert should have an Italian accent, too: Try slices of fresh pears topped with mascarpone and a warm walnut-caramel sauce.

5017191~"Even folks in the South, where pimiento cheese is lovingly called the ""pâté of the South,"" will give you a quizzical look when you mention this burger. I always thought its true home was around Columbia, South Carolina, and the lower upstate area. But then I saw a pimiento cheeseburger on the menu in a wonderful burger joint and restaurant called Litton's, in Knoxville, Tennessee, so I guess a good idea can cross state lines. So here's how to do it, complete with a little pimiento cheese recipe, but the burger's not bad even if you have to use a good-quality store-bought pimiento cheese."

5017207~Adding salt to this classic sauce lets you taste the rich complexity of the caramel, not just the sweetness. To save time, feel free to replace the almonds and butter with 1/2 cup store-bought roasted almond butter (with no added sugar). Just stir in the salt and almond extract and it's recipe-ready.
5017208~This recipe makes great use of rotisserie chicken, available at most supermarkets.

5017211~Clams in an oil and garlic sauce are found all over Spain but are especially good in Andalusia, where tiny bean clams are used. Cockles, Manila clams, and small littlenecks work well, too. Serve plenty of crusty bread to soak up the sauce.
5017212~Highly recommended!
5017213~This recipe is an adaptation of the wonderful smash of vegetable served on the sliced-pork sandwiches at Philadelphia's Tony Lukes. Liberated from the bread, the dish has a slight bitterness that makes a great foil for the richness of Broiled Duck Breasts with Orange Chipotle Sauce .

5017226~The beauty and subtlety of wild garlic makes this dish very appealing, and fresh curry leaves add a fragrance that is quite seductive. During the summer months, we shell fresh coco beans and cook them directly in the curry until soft. In winter, we soak dried cannellini beans overnight and precook them in water for an hour or so over gentle heat, with one or two herbs added for flavor. I like to serve this curry just as it is, but you could add chunks of white fish to it.

5017243~Korean pickled cabbage, a.k.a. kimchi, provides the spice in these savory fritters, while soaked raw mung beans hold the flourless pancakes together. They're great with or without the dipping sauce and pickled pears.
5017244~Mischa Barton and Kate Beckinsale have spent time in the Santa Monica steak house with a funky decor (picture mirrored walls and antler chandeliers).

5017253~Based on a classic pâte brisée, the buttery French pastry dough used for making pies and tarts, this pie crust dough is easy to work with and wonderfully versatile.
5017254~I used to be put off by poaching chicken as I feared it was more complicated than my simple fried version. But it's actually much easier, because while the chicken poaches you can prepare the rest of the food. These days I often poach 3 or 4 chicken breasts at a time, then keep them in the fridge so I can toss them into salads over the following days. Poaching really helps to keep the moisture in the meat, so the end result is much more enjoyable than dried, overcooked chicken.

5017257~"Aromatic spice and herb blends can quickly turn an ordinary soup recipe into something extraordinary. Here they transform a basic carrot soup into a special concoction you'll crave again and again. So start utilizing the ""cook once, eat twice"" theory; just freeze half of the recipe or make a double batch whenever possible."
5017258~Cardamom is a spice not commonly used in the United States. A member of the ginger family, this warm, sweet spice is traditionally found in Indian cooking, flavoring a wide variety of curries, rice dishes, and Indian-style desserts.
5018955~Green beans have a certain suave, slender elegance that makes them a classic accompaniment to rosy-red roast beef. But too often, they get short shrift: a quick drizzle of butter, a squirt of lemon, and onto the table they go. We suggest you coddle them a little this year. Try tossing them in a hot skillet with shallots and pecans that get caramelized in buttery brown sugar, and you'll see just how special green beans can be.
5017260~A moist, deeply flavored confection studded with rum-soaked raisins and crunchy pecans, this streamlined one-bowl cake will get compliments even for novice bakers. Plus, it keeps for days. To dress up each serving, why not use store-bought eggnog, which has the consistency of custard sauce.
5017261~"Chimay ""À La Bière"" cheese is a Belgian smooth semisoft cheese that is washed with Chimay beer. It has a pungent aroma and mild flavor. Look for it in specialty cheese shops or on amazon.com or igourmet.com, or try another cheese with a beer-washed rind, such as German Temptin cheese."

5017297~The kitchen was the domain of Miraglia Eriquez's grandmother, but this recipe was her grandfather's specialty. Sitting at the dining table, Poppy, as he was known, would peel and cut oranges, toss the pieces into glasses, and cover them with red wine. After the oranges soaked up and sweetened the wine, he would eat forkfuls of the fruit, then down the drink. It was—and is—the perfect prelude to dessert.

5017320~"Bluefish is remarkably delicious and versatile. It is wonderful on the grill, its fatty richness complemented by the flavor of wood smoke. That richness (""oiliness"" to the minds of some) causes many people to shun bluefish and other similar ocean brethren. All I can say is, oh well, more for me. Here orange zest provides an acidic tang that helps to balance the flavors, and the slow, low heat of the smoldering wood cooks the fish without drying it out."

Be sure to have plenty of coffee and an assortment of teas on hand to complete the meal.

5017342~Watch out, potato chips. Kale chips are this year's latest craze in the snack department. Suddenly they seem to be everywhere, and for a hefty price. You won't believe how easy these crisps are to make at home for a fraction of the cost, and the Parmigiano and freshly ground pepper seasoning complements the kale beautifully. Bet you can't eat just one! Take it from us: When it comes to kale chips, curly kale beats Tuscan kale.

5017383~"Of all the ways to prepare shrimp, the grill delivers the best flavor. Although unadorned ""shrimp on the barbie"" are great, an easily assembled gingery barbecue sauce makes them that much better. You can save time by buying already shelled and deveined shrimp, but our recipe developer, Alexis Touchet, who grew up in shrimp country in southwest Louisiana, thinks shell-on shrimp are better quality. Depending on where you live and what's in your market, you may not have much choice. Freshness trumps all, so don't hesitate to use your nose in deciding which shrimp to buy."
5017384~Jason Cobler, the lead bartender of Harvest in Louisville, Kentucky, shared this recipe with Epicurious. Inspired by the Mint Julep, this is a lighter cocktail that will get you going the day after the Kentucky Derby.
5017385~This recipe is an accompaniment for Farfalle with Diced Tomatoes and Feta Cheese.
5020091~You can use this simple formula to wake up the Beer-Can Chicken , add another layer of flavor to the Barbecued Chicken , or sass up plenty of things that aren't poultry, like pork, steak, or vegetables.

5017389~These make-ahead packs are perfect for camping trips as well as quick and easy breakfasts on the go. The Mexican-inspired ingredients are topped with baked eggs and served with tortillas for a hearty morning meal.
5017390~This satisfying salad is great alongside broiled fish, roast chicken, or a simple steak. To turn it into a vegetarian meal, fold in sliced hard-boiled eggs.
5017391~Buttermilk adds the tang, while bacon lends crunch to this dish.

5017393~"""You should tell your readers about Bistro Banlieue in Lombard,"" writes Judith Gill of Chicago, Illinois. ""The smoked salmon, goat cheese, and leek tart alone is worth the short drive from Chicago."""
5017394~Highly recommended!
5017395~"In early spring, colonists would tap into sugar maple trees to draw off the smoky-sweet syrup, which was a substitute for expensive imported sugar. Here, the syrup is brushed onto the turkey to add a deep golden finish. New Englanders liked their gravies rich and dark, and often kept a box of browned or ""scorched"" flour on hand to aid in browning, as well as flavoring and thickening. This delectable gravy borrows that technique. Be sure to start the gravy early in the day."
5017396~In addition to the shiitake mushrooms called for here, look for morels, porcini or even button mushrooms, all of which are available during late spring early summer months.
5017397~Like curry, za'atar is a spice blend that varies from cook to cook in the Middle East, its birthplace. My father was Assyrian, so I've always enjoyed the flavors of the region (though the closest I've yet traveled is Turkey). This is my interpretation, and it reflects my priorities: my favorite part of za'atar is the tart sumac, so it's particularly heavy in my version. And while some cooks grind their spices together, I like to leave the sesame seeds whole. You can find sumac in Middle Eastern groceries and from online sources such as Penzeys and Kalustyan's. For a perfect, quick snack, combine with olive oil and brush on pita.
5017398~Highly recommended!
5017399~The airy ricotta filling—with chocolate chips and flecks of candied orange peel speckled throughout—makes for a perfect marriage of Italian and American.

5017408~This recipe was created to accompany Garbanzo Bean and Potato Fritters with Red Bell Pepper Harissa.
5017409~Agave nectar, a product of the agave plant better known as the source of tequila, blends beautifully with Old World Spanish sherry for a gentle sweet-and-sour glaze and luscious gravy. Because agave nectar has a low glycemic index, it's the new darling of the health-conscious crowd who are trying to lower their sugar intake. Although making the brown turkey stock for the gravy is an extra step, it can be done weeks ahead and frozen, and it's the secret behind a truly memorable gravy.
5017410~Mashed Yams and Apples and Fried Onion Rings are superb accompaniments.
5017411~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 15 min
5017412~Of course, you can always take a simple store-bought rotisserie chicken to a picnic, but this Indian spin is way more fun. We love the chickpea layer so much that we make it even when there's no picnic planned.

5017414~This turkey is basted with Port, a wine exported to the colonies by English merchants in Portugal; for a time it was boycotted by the revolutionaries.

5017419~Adding watercress to potato salad gives this old standby new life. We particularly like the contrast of the crisp, peppery green against the warm, vinegar- and mustard-spiced potatoes.
5017420~Why you'll make it: Because it's that one easy, really delicious recipe for barbecued chicken that every cook needs. Grilling bone-in chicken takes a bit more time than boneless, but the flavor payoff is worth it. Stay close to the grill and flip the pieces every six to eight minutes. Rub spices on the chicken at least six hours ahead.
5017421~Use plums that hold their shape when cooked, such as black or red (avoid soft-fleshed Santa Rosas). If you prefer a taller pie, use all 5 pounds of fruit.

5017428~"The inspiration for this was Sarah's grandmother (""nan"") Dulcie in Tasmania, who always used to add some honey to the pan before roasting her carrots. I'm not sure what Dulcie would have thought about a tahini yogurt sauce served alongside, but the sweetness of the carrots certainly welcomes it. Make this extra vibrant by using different-colored carrots."

5017433~For maximum juiciness and flavor, pound and season the turkey breasts 24 hours in advance. Swaddling the breasts in butter-rubbed cheesecloth and cooking them in a roasting pan with broth yields a tender, succulent result. This turkey roulade recipe is perfect for a crowd, but is easily halved to feed a smaller crew. Serve a rich gravy alongside.
5017434~Highly recommended!
5017435~I love visiting Buddhist temples in Asia, not for religious reasons but because I enjoy the food served in their restaurants. This recipe was inspired by the fried vegetarian spring rolls I ate at the Shaolin Temple.
5017436~Look for red curry paste in the Asian section of the supermarket. Serve with: Lentil and rice pilaf and sautéed mixed vegetables. Dessert: Sliced papaya and mango.

5017442~A great summer salad requires three things: fresh greens, a tart, seasonal dressing (made here with grated tomato), and a light hand to toss the ingredients together so the lettuces stay perky.
5017443~Highly recommended!
5017444~This delightful custard sauce-infused with black currant tea for a unique accent-is made with milk instead of cream. Begin preparing it a day ahead.
5017445~f you're making the beans to use for the soup or the sausages, be sure to save the cooking liquid.
5017446~Great over rice or toasted French bread.
5017447~You can find the Neufchâtel cheese called for here next to the cream cheese at your supermarket.
5017448~This springtime dish would go nicely with sliced red and yellow tomatoes drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette; offer corn muffins, too. End the dinner with wedges of chocolate mousse cake.

5017453~Thick-cut seasoned potatoes can be roasted along with tortilla chicken drumsticks . The mayonnaise works as a zesty dip for both, so you may want to double the amount.
5017454~Miraglia Eriquez's Aunt Dottie loved this indulgent appetizer, which was served at her favorite Italian-American restaurants. A talented, ambitious home cook, Dottie tinkered in her kitchen until she came up with her own version. We're glad she did. The lemon and capers in the anchovy-butter sauce cut through the richness of soft, stretchy mozzarella in a pocket of crisp fried bread.
5017455~Highly recommended!
5017456~The trees of Hansel and Gretel's forest surely had bark like this, sparkling with sugar crystals and tasting of sylvan honey. Though the biscuits pair wonderfully with blueberries in gin syrup, they also make an excellent accompaniment to a cheese course—particularly with a nice triple-crème.
5017457~Some of the chicken's flavorful poaching liquid gets added to the dressing in this spicy Asian-accented dish.
5017458~This cheat's tiramisu is so easy and delicious (perfect for stress-free entertaining!). Pretty much anything with coffee in it usually gets my vote!

5017460~Highly recommended!

5017462~Unlike most brined turkeys, this one can be stuffed because the apple-cider brine contains less salt than the typical recipe. Begin brining two days ahead.
5017463~Provide knives so your guests can slice the sections into individual ribs. Have lots of damp paper towels on hand.
5017464~Brushing the underside of the dough with egg wash for this pot pie recipe creates an airtight seal so that steam will push the pastry lids into a dramatic dome during baking.
5017465~This recipe was created to accompany Seared Scallops with Tarragon Cream.
5017466~Who says that Pimm's is just for Pimm's Cups? Add Champagne, and it becomes an especially refreshing punch. Pimm's was created in the 1840s by an English oyster bar owner, and it became one of the most popular beverages in England. The exact recipe is a secret, but we do know that it is a gin-based liqueur flavored with spices and fruit. It is generally consumed in the Pimm's Cup with ginger ale and a fancy fruit garnish. This party punch takes it one step farther, letting it macerate with fruit and then adding Champagne rather than soda.

5017471~A hit of coffee and a blend of spices (cinnamon, cardamom, and two kinds of ginger) perk up this shortbread.
5017472~These are no ordinary corn dogs. The fragrant buttermilk-cornmeal batter is laced with a hint of honey, spices, and delicious crumbles of bacon.

5017477~When a butcher eats a salad, it tends to contain lots of meat and few vegetables. At Chez Navarre Jerome Navarre serves a version he learned from his father, a butcher.
5017478~"Jan Schroeder of Corvallis, Oregon, writes: ""A great thing about my job is that I get to do a lot of cooking. I work for the berry industry and one of my duties is developing recipes. I often get ideas from local chefs, but it's also rewarding to see what I can come up with on my own."""
5017479~The coffee in this cake may be replaced with a sweet fruit liqueur or with orange juice.
5017480~In this simplified version of raclette, one of Switzerland's classic dishes, Swiss cheese replaces raclette cheese, and the cheese is melted in individual portions instead of being scraped from a large wheel as it melts. This dish makes a terrific appetizer, or it can be served with a green salad.
5017481~The curries that are sold in the markets of southern Thailand inspired this heavily spiced dish. Chef Boetz says this delicious main course is a hybrid of an Indian and a Thai curry. The use of dried spices (coriander, cardamom, cumin) is common in Indian curries; coconut milk and fresh, aromatic ingredients (cilantro, lemongrass, galangal) are often used in Thai curries.
5017482~I still have fond memories of learning to make these with my mum in our kitchen. Gyoza are very versatile—you can pan-fry, steam, boil or deep-fry them, or simply add a couple to your noodle soup. These dumplings also freeze well in zip-lock bags.
5017483~When it comes to buying feta, you've got choices. We love the firm texture and sheep's-milk tang of Bulgarian or Greek.
5017484~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5017485~For more variety, stir in other finely chopped herbs such as basil, thyme, or tarragon.
5017486~The cornmeal biscuit topping adds some crunch to the winning combination of fresh strawberries and rhubarb.
5017487~Good for Seasoning: Flank steak; pork; chicken; salmon
5017488~The pepper skins add smokiness to the salad, so don’t peel them. Bonus: That makes life a lot easier.
5017489~In the following recipe, scalloped potatoes, often soaked with cream and cheese, are combined with parsnips and cooked with broth and low-fat milk instead. Though lighter, they are still delicious.
5017490~Highly recommended!
5017491~Not your average sundae: Strawberry sorbet takes the place of ice cream; Prosecco sabayon (an airy, foamy custard) is the sauce; and sugared almonds add crunch.

5017502~This bright and sophisticated dish is offered at Gresslin's in London, England.
5017503~The key to cooking with chiles is to think of their heat not as a dare but as another essential building block of flavor, right alongside salt, acid, and fat. Rather than overpowering a dish, a perfectly calibrated prickle of spice enhances the other elements and wakes up the palate.
5017504~Highly recommended!
5017505~Purchased puff pastry simplifies this flavorful starter. What to drink: Open a bottle of Champagne or Sancerre to pour with the cheese twists and the Corn and Lobster Chowder.
5017506~Highway 84 runs from Santa Fe to Colorado. About forty minutes north of Santa Fe, the highway cuts a paved path through Ohkay Owingeh, a Native American reservation, and the roadside becomes dense with fast-food outlets, outposts of national grocery chains, Walmart, and billboards for Ohkay Casino, Hutch and Norma Naranjo's sprawling midcentury home is set about fifty years back from the road, a shrine to the tug-of-war between new ways and traditional ones. In the backyward Mr. Naranjo built two hornos (behive-shaped adobe ovens). Inside the house, a handmade wreath of dried chiles hangs on one wall and a string of made-for-tourists ceramic peppers on another. A naïve painting of St. Francis hangs not far from a cluster of the dream catchers that the couple and their two grown children fashion from string, feathers, and yarn, just as their Pueblo ancestors did.
5017507~The slaw would be perfect with grilled pork or lamb, or use it as a topping for fish tacos.
5017508~"Selma Hurwitz of Potomac, Maryland, writes: ""I'm an artist, and I think that without question cooking is very creative. You can't be afraid to experiment in the kitchen. I often get ideas from cookbooks and recipes from friends, and I'll add my own touches. The apple cake is inspired by a cookbook from Michigan — I just added more rum and spices. Both recipes are great for company and freeze beautifully."""

5017512~No offense to salsa, but come on, who doesn't love a gooey, cheesy bean dip, bubbling hot like lava from the broiler? If you're a chile head, you'll probably want to up the number of chiles and leave the seeds in. If your friends are more, ahem, delicate, then stick with one chile and remove the seeds and ribs.
5017513~Highly recommended!
5017514~Wear gloves when working with chiles.

5017517~The buttery sauce that coats the crabmeat and the shells is part of the pleasure of this dish; to really enjoy it, dispense with the utensils and just eat the crab with your hands. Serve with a green salad dressed with tarragon vinaigrette and plenty of crusty sourdough bread.

5017524~When using an outdoor grill, add a handful of fresh charcoal to the embers after serving the main course; when it's time to cook the nectarines, the fire should be at the right temperature. Remember to brush the grill clean before adding the fruit. Sour cream is a good substitute for the crème fraîche.
5017525~Highly recommended!

5017527~Look for the black sesame seeds in the Asian foods section of a specialty market; they add a dramatic touch to this simple side dish. If you can't find them, just use all white seeds instead.
5017528~Couscous is easy to cook—just add it to boiling water, remove it from the heat, and let it stand for a few minutes until the water is absorbed. The addition of cinnamon, lemon peel, garbanzo beans and golden raisins gives this side dish a Mediterranean flair.
5017529~Highly recommended!

5017531~A hearty combination of textures and flavors.

5017535~Coarsely ground black pepper lends a spicy note to this dense, moist brownie cake studded with dried cherries and chocolate chips.
5017536~Cooking the sea bass in parchment paper is a great technique — it keeps the pistachio topping in place and allows you to brown both the fish and the topping in the skillet (the parchment becomes translucent so you can see the browning. Since Gras is on the West Coast, he likes to use Dungeness crab when he makes this dish. We've substituted jumbo lump crabmeat because it's available year round nationwide.
5017537~Hoppin' John is a traditional southern dish of black-eyed peas and salt pork served with rice. Here, it's a risotto dotted with black-eyed peas and flavored with bacon and pancetta. This is an unconventional method for making risotto — rather than slowly adding hot stock to the rice, Rollins adds it, unheated, in just 2 batches. This will allow you more time for preparing the chops that go along with it.
5017538~Look for black sesame seeds in the Asian foods section of a specialty market. If you can't find them, use white seeds instead.
5017539~This faster and healthier version of Chicken Parmesan is perfect for a cozy weeknight dinner. Serve with garlic bread and a side salad to round out the meal.
5017540~If you're short on time or refrigerator space, you can preseason the pork for only 1 to 2 hours.
5017541~If the crowd is larger than eight, make two frittatas and keep one warm. Served in wedges, frittatas are delicious hot, warm, or at room temperature.

5017552~Highly recommended!
5017553~A cobbler is the easiest way to get to something similar to a pie—meltingly tender and juicy fruit with a crusty topping—without having to make, roll out, and crimp pie dough. Biscuit dough, in general, is easy and fast to assemble, but the cream dough below is a real cinch because you don't even have to blend butter into the flour mixture; you just pour in heavy cream and stir, then pat it out with your hands. A round cutter is your default shape but feel free to rummage through your cookie cutter collection for something fun, such as a leaf or diamond.
5017554~I have a love of potatoes that is unlike any other love. I grew up eating them often as a kid—almost every day—so now I’m always looking for new ways to incorporate this versatile vegetable into my everyday life. There’s just something so special about biscuits loaded with shredded potatoes, cheddar cheese, and chives. I can’t put it into words, but I feel like I don’t have to because you get it. It’s the baked potato you never knew you wanted . . . in biscuit form.
5017555~Any size mini-muffin pan can be used to bake the tartlets, but the nonstick variety works best.
5017556~Peperonata—an Italian condiment usually made of sautéed tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic—is spiced up with a poblano chile. Here, we've added chicken breasts to turn it into a satisfying main course. Serve Italian-style, over polenta, or Mexican—style, wrapped in warm tortillas with slices of avocado and dollops of sour cream. Instead of chicken, you can also spoon the peperonata over grilled flank steak or crusty grilled bread.
5017557~These are unusually light, with a crunchy filling. A dollop of thick, tangy Greek yogurt is a nice finishing touch.
5017558~You can steam, grill, boil or broil the shrimp or, even easier, buy them already cooked. Saffron rice and greens mixed with some olives, red onion slices and a garlicky olive oil dressing are perfect side dishes. Sliced oranges sprinkled with a bit of sweet Sherry and paired with some crisp sugar cookies would round out the Spanish-inspired menu.
5017559~The recipe calls for both chicken broth and beef broth, but using either one or the other will give an equally good result.
5017560~Traditional beef stew with Spanish overtones. It's delicious over rice or pasta.

5017564~The color yellow symbolized joy for medieval Arabs, who were cultivating saffron in Spain by 960 c.e. Sephardic Jews were equally inspired by the coveted spice, and golden rice became a holiday and Sabbath tradition. This version, made with basmati rice, is punctuated by caramelized onion, currants, and fried almonds.

5017576~Highly recommended!
5017577~If you choose to bake only one cookie from this collection, make it these bites. The crisp cookie base provides the perfect contrasting setup to the luscious caramel-flavored dulce de leche—caramelized milk—hidden under the creamiest cheesecake layer. The final snazzy drizzle of dulce de leche is not essential, we know, but it makes the bites downright irresistible.
5017578~Unlike savory blini, crêpes traditionally served with butter, caviar, and sour cream, these are stuffed with fruit preserves, making them ideal for dessert.
5017579~These delightful cupcakes are great as soon as they've cooled, but their carrot-cake moistness and hint of spice really come through the day after they're baked.
5017580~Comfort food, August-style: A creamed-vegetable stew tastes mighty fine ladled over pillowy biscuits dotted with chives. A store-bought smoked turkey leg deepens the stew's flavor almost effortlessly—its bone and skin go into making the broth (along with the corn cobs and silk), and its meat is stirred into the stew.
5017581~Highly recommended!
5017582~Escoffier codified the mother sauces of French cooking. In the Italian-American tradition, there is only one: tomato sauce. Call it marinara (we do), call it gravy (we don't), call it whatever your grandma called it. It's tomato sauce. There's almost nothing we won't cook in it or put it on.
5017583~The contrast of textures and flavors—crunchy pine nuts, creamy goat cheese, acidic tomatoes, and spicy arugula—adds complexity to this simple salad. It makes a great side dish to steak or chicken or a light lunch for two.
5017584~Consider this delicious dish as a vegetarian main course, too.
5017585~Try these sprinkled on peanut butter toast or stirred into plain yogurt that's been seasoned with fresh lemon juice and salt.
5017586~Brining the nuts with herbs and some spice infuses them from the inside out, and the long roasting time gives them extra toasty flavor.
5017587~Use this focaccia to make Sausage, Bell Pepper, and Onion Sandwiches and Genoa Toasts.
5017588~Highly recommended!
5017589~Traditional Asian meals tend to be full of veggies, and this one won't disappoint. Also, peanuts provide protein and off-the-chart levels of resveratrol, the same heart-smart compound found in red wine.
5017590~An accompaniment to Herb Salad Spring Rolls.
5017591~A lovely side dish with big flavors‑and only a single teaspoon of oil.
5017592~Lots of fun: pizza with flavors reminiscent of the classic Reuben sandwich.
5017593~Highly recommended!
5017594~This rich, satisfying main course would be nice with a salad of chopped fresh tomatoes, yellow bell peppers, black olives, and sweet onion. Crusty breadsticks round out the meal, which might end with a plate of assorted grape clusters and anise biscuits.
5017595~A bold medley of cumin, cayenne, corn, and cilantro ups the flavor here. Great with: Grilled-fish tacos, steak fajitas, or chipotle-rubbed chicken.
5017596~For a real southern meal, pair this dish with the bacon scallion hush puppies.
5017597~Although traditional Italian polenta is simmered for nearly an hour, resulting in a very creamy consistency, for the following recipe we preferred the more rustic texture of this quickly cooked version.
5017598~Bubbly with benefits? Ginger may help prevent cancer by halting abnormal cell growth. (We'll take two!)
5017599~Dark meat stands up nicely to bold Asian flavors.
5017600~This is especially pretty made with a mix of orange and purple carrots, and even nicer if you flute the carrots lengthwise with a channel knife before slicing them—this results in slices with pretty scalloped edges. A channel knife is handy for cutting decorative strips of citrus zest, too; you can pick one up in nearly any gourmet shop.
5018707~Think of this as a streamlined and guilt-free version of scalloped potatoes. It's a toss-and-dump dish, in which I toss sliced potatoes with a little melted butter, dump them in a dish, then cover them with milk—healthier than heavy cream—that I've thickened slightly with a bit of flour (the flour keeps the milk from separating). The cheese topping is optional; with or without it, in less than an hour you will be rewarded with lusciously creamy potatoes along with that all-important browned crust.
5017602~A couple of rosemary sprigs are all you need to flavor each whole trout. Serve with tabbouleh.

5017604~This thick and comforting dish is delicious sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese.

5017616~Chef Renee Erickson has access to the best seafood anywhere; when it comes to sardines, she goes with Matiz sardines in olive oil.
5017617~The combination of sauerkraut, sausages, and mustard is well loved in Germany—and beyond. Here, dark beer enhances the sauerkraut, and the hot dogs are simmered in fruity Belgian lambic.
5017618~This simple salad is designed to highlight the delightful spotted cargamanto beans. You can use either the red or white variety; both lose their mottled colors when cooked. Because these beans are so meaty, we use a dressing inspired by chimichurri, the Argentinean sauce for grilled meats.

5017620~"Green chiles pickled in soy sauce and vinegar are a traditional Korean banchan, so food editor Lillian Chou, who created this menu, was surprised when she discovered a similar dish made with jalapeños and soy sauce at a taco bar in Mexico. But it's no wonder the combination has universal appeal. Here, Chou calls for brown sugar and lemon zest in place of vinegar, and the ingredients hit all the right spots: hot, salty, and a little sweet. Chile fanatics will be happy to munch on these just as they are, but the jalapeños and their liquid also make a terrific accompaniment to the first course of <epi:recieplink id=""3510910"">shrimp and scallion pancakes.</epi:recieplink>"

5017622~Skillet-toasting quinoa will add texture and flavor to a dish. I recommend using a nonstick skillet for this. If you use a standard skillet, the quinoa requires more attention and the skillet needs occasional scraping. The goal is for the quinoa to retain its tenderness but acquire a toasted exterior. You can cook the quinoa more or less, according to your taste preferences.

5017636~Katniss's favorite food from the Capitol is the delicious lamb stew with dried plums. It's no coincidence that this is her favorite dish. Soups and stews are common foods in the Seam, and this healthy and filling dish likely reminded her of the home and family she desperately missed. (The Hunger Games, Chapter 9)

5017639~This pastry recipe was one of those rare revelations that send shock waves through our test kitchens: How utterly brilliant to make extra dough, freeze it, and then just grate it directly into the pans when you need it! Rowe makes these adorable little tarts with damson plums, but we've found that prune plums work just as well. Although the pastry and compote make enough for twice this many tarts, they keep beautifully and they are so good you will be glad to have extra on hand.
5017640~A delicious blend of classic flavors.

5017655~If four people eat a mix of light and dark skinless meat, you'll have enough leftovers for two more meals. Bonus: Your oven does all but 10 minutes of the work.
5017656~You can prepare the polenta a day ahead. The chicken and vegetables can be made earlier in the day, and both can be reheated before serving. Team this with a radicchio and arugula salad, and uncork a Pinot Grigio.

5017668~When the nights turn blustery and the temperature drops, I know that roasted vegetable season has arrived, and I embrace it with reckless abandon. I'll roast any kind of sturdy vegetable that I can cut up and fit into my oven, but one of my favorites is cauliflower, preferably tossed with whole cumin seeds. Not only does the cumin act as a natural remedy to help reduce the dreaded intestinal gas factor (or so I've been told), but it also adds a pleasant earthy flavor to balance the assertive tang of the vegetable.
5017669~Highly recommended!
5017670~The coconut tuiles (cookies) that go into this layered dessert (left) are delicate, so the recipe provides for quite a few extras to allow for breakage. Tuiles are also terrific with ice cream. The syrup gets an interesting (and delicious) kick from nontraditional dessert ingredients like black peppercorns and a jalapeño chili.
5017671~Corn husks can be transformed into a surprisingly flavorful oil. At Seäsonal, this vinaigrette is tossed with Bibb lettuce, radishes, and crisp pumpernickel croutons.
5017672~No salt is used in this traditional Asian recipe. Folding the rice from the top to the bottom of the pan after cooking helps distribute moisture evenly.

5017675~Homemade strawberry-vanilla jam and toasty almonds top off this easy gluten-free tart.
5017676~Grilling sweetbreads gives them a crispy crust that contrasts beautifully with their creamy, tender interior. In Argentina, sweetbreads are usually grilled whole, but we find people are less intimidated by them when they're prepared this way — separated into pieces. As with all offal, be sure the sweetbreads are very fresh.

5017681~Every cook should have a good brisket recipe at the ready, and this one's a doozy. Braised with lots of browned onions, carrots, and celery in a mix of chicken broth and crushed tomatoes, the beef exits the oven full-flavored and fork-tender, ready to be shredded for the country hash or sliced and served with mashed potatoes for a homey dinner (though it's even better if you can wait a day). By all means, freeze the leftover braising liquid; it's wonderful as a sauce for fettuccine or as the base for a vegetable barley soup.

5017688~If you're trying to incorporate more dark leafy greens into your meals, Swiss chard is a great starter vegetable. It cooks quickly compared to kale and collards, and the stems are as delicious as the leaves. In fact, the stems are the prized portion of the plant in Provence, and that's not something kale or collards can brag about.

5017694~This is an almost perfect dish for the home cook because it's economical, healthy, and scrumptious! You can whip it up anytime you have leftover cooked barley, brown rice, or quinoa from the night before. You could even reinvigorate a container of rice from last night's Chinese or Indian takeout! For a carnivore's take on this dish, add a cup of browned ground meat in place of 1 cup of the cooked barley or other grain.
5017695~Watson, who's from Louisiana, grew up on his mom's dirty rice; that dish helped inspire this bastardized fried version. The chicken-liver base tastes very concentrated and intense on its own, but becomes nicely balanced in the finished dish.

5017731~South Indians don't use ghee in cooking the way North Indians do, much preferring their coconut oil. But they always have a spoonful with their parboiled rice and dhal.

5017758~This is a simple way to prepare whole fish, yet one that few Western cooks have mastered. In the Vietnamese culture, a properly steamed fish is a benchmark for chefs, and those who can't do it right are considered to be bad cooks. A perfectly steamed fish has flesh that is just cooked at the bone, never dry. Typically, whole fish are not served with the liquid in which it was steamed, which is too fishy tasting, and any sauce is added at the end, after the fish has been cooked. In this classic Chinese preparation, the fish is topped with scallions, cilantro and ginger, then doused with hot oil, which releases the flavor of the aromatics into the flesh of the fish.
5017759~Highly recommended!
5017760~We prefer wild salmon for this recipe because it has a milder flavor and is more environmentally friendly than farmed varieties.
5017761~Talk about comfort food. This traditional stew combines all manner of meat with two different kinds of tubers. Sour orange lends a uniquely Caribbean flair. We like to brighten our sancocho by pairing it with avocado, rice, and cilantro, and to inject a little heat with a splash of hot sauce. We would not turn down an accompanying plate of crunchy tostones (twice-fried green plantains).

5017811~"Pennsylvania is now a national center for cultivated exotic or ""specialty"" mushrooms like shiitake and crimini, but early colonists found plenty of familiar wild mushrooms growing free for the picking in the forests of their new world. The tradition finds expression in this mushroom-lover's dressing, which blends both wild and cultivated fungi for maximum flavor."

5017816~This Italian spin on the Mimosa gets its unique flavor from Aperol, a bright-orange Italian liqueur made from bitter oranges, rhubarb, and herbs. Its similar to Campari, but less bitter and more floral. In Italy, Aperol is served on the rocks mixed with Prosecco and a splash of club soda. In this recipe, the club soda has been replaced with a little fresh orange juice.
5017817~Fideos, pasta nests that are often toasted in oil, are popular on the eastern coast of Spain. Here, the sauce is enhanced with a sofrito, a concentrated mixture that imparts a deep tomato flavor. The browned fideos slowly absorb the seafood-based sauce as they cook.
5017818~A clever, deconstructed BLT: Bread coats chicken in the form of breadcrumbs,bacon is cooked with lettuce and tomato for a simple side, and a dollop of seasoned mayonnaise acts as a sauce.
5017819~Because these crab cakes are made with lots of crab meat and not much filler, they require gentle handling during cooking, but the results are well worth the extra effort.
5017820~The traditional stuffed pork roast is so delicious but so laborious. This chicken has all the same garlicky, herby flavors—not to mention lots of crispy bacon bits—and it's optimized for a weeknight meal.
5017821~"The technique: High heat equals great flavor—roasting the new potatoes browns and crisps the skin, providing a little bit of crunch.
The payoff: Hearty potato taste and texture with only 25 minutes of prep."
5017822~Garnish with whole gingersnaps, cherries and mint for a beautiful presentation. Begin preparing the cake a day before the party.

5017831~If you want to study the art of meatless barbecue, India is the place to do it. This nation of more than a billion people has more vegetarians than there are people in the United States. Over the centuries, Indian grill masters have evolved a highly sophisticated style of vegetarian barbecue—dishes bursting with flavor (not to mention dairy and grain proteins). It's grilling so complex and satisfying, you'll never miss the meat. Tandoori aloo (potato) turns up at grill parlors throughout northern India. The best I've ever tasted came from the landmark restaurant Moti Mahal in Delhi; the potatoes were packed with cheese, slathered with spice paste, and crusted with sesame seeds.
5017832~To save even more time, buy the peppercorn medley packaged in a pepper grinder in the spice section of the supermarket. Serve with: Curried rice and sautéed snow peas.
5017833~Believe it or not, watermelon and feta make a great pairing. Toss in some hot chili peppers and cilantro and you have a salad to delight everyone who tries it. Buy seedless watermelon for this—you won't be disappointed when you try it!
5017834~One of my favorite classic bistro dishes is steak Diane, a paragon of quick cooking that finds steak swathed in a cream sauce mightily seasoned with mustard and enhanced with cognac. The next time you feel yourself feeling those bistro pangs, try my take on steak Diane, made with chicken instead of beef, and my version of the traditional sauce with shallots and mustard. Roasted garlic mashed potatoes is a perfect accompaniment; the potatoes will soak up the sauce. Or serve it with fries and an ice-cold Belgian beer.

5017865~Use the smallest clams you can find. Mussels would also work in this dish. Serve with: Portuguese rolls and a green salad.
5017866~Rich and satisfying, this is sure to be the hit of the party-especially if it's a cold day.
5017867~Don't say we didn't warn you! These hors d'oeuvresize soft tacos will be gobbled up faster than you can say tinga de pollo. But no need to fear, because the recipe is easily doubled, which means you'll be tasting and toasting until the clock strikes midnight.

5017893~Chef Suzanne Goin prepares this dish with Taylor Bay Scallops in the shell, but it's also delicious with regular bay scallops, which are more widely available. Be sure to use a good amontillado, the medium-dry Sherry that is lightly aged to give it a mellow, nutty flavor. What to drink: Condrieu, an aromatic Rhône white made with Viognier grapes.

5017898~How to choose corn: Look for tight, squeaky, green husks and rows of kernels that feel taut and full when you run your hands over the cobs.
5017899~Kevin Graham, of Graham's in New Orleans, occasionally adds a Parmesan sauce to go with the tomato cream.

5017901~These pickled peppers work well with Cheddar and other firm/hard cheeses.
5017902~A good cut of meat for this recipe is the butt portion of a bone-in, water-added ham. For optimum flavor, I like to prebake the ham, then simply slice away what I need from the bone.
5017903~This standard diner salad may have petered out in the early '90s, but this version reminds us why it was popular in the first place. Smoky chicken and pork stand in for the typical drab turkey and ham, and the addition of herb-packed chimichurri dressing makes this salad fresh again.
5017904~Ravigote sauce is piquant vinaigrette that typically contains onions, capers, and herbs. The hard-boiled egg in this rendition gives the sauce body.

5017911~A bit of Spanish chorizo goes a long way, lending another dimension to a skillet full of mouthwatering clams and potatoes.
5017912~Tri-tip is flavorful and well-marbled, but because its really a roast rather than a steak, salt and seasonings dont affect it the same way they do a thinner cut. Thats where this Mediterranean-inspired relish comes in. The combination of roasted red pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, and capers adds savor to every bite.
5017913~Borracho means drunk, and it refers to the beer in the cooking liquid. If you're cooking beans and pork roast at the same time, you can use the fatty pieces of pork that you remove while carving to add flavor to the beans. Otherwise, use some bacon.
5017914~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5017915~Thai food lovers will recognize this soup as the classic tom yaam goong. In its homeland the dish would have far more hot chilies. We've toned down the heat for newcomers to this cuisine, but veterans can add more chilies to make this soup as incendiary as they wish.

5017921~The Linzer cookie, thought to have originated in the city of Linz, is based on the Linzertorte, one of the most famous and beloved confections in Austria.

5017993~Sean Traynor, bartender at The Windsor in Phoenix, Arizona, created this crisp, beautifully hued cocktail for our story Spring Cocktails Perfect for Brunch. Sparkling wine is often used to top off a drink, but in this case Traynor mixes it with the rest of the ingredients in the cocktail shaker. The reason? He's using it more for its acidity and flavor than effervescence. For pure peach flavor, Traynor insists on a true peach-based liqueur, so put away the peach Schnapps; he recommends Sathenay Crème de Pêche de Vigne Liqueur, Rothman & Winter Orchard Peach Liqueur, or Massenez Crème de Pêche.
5017994~"Here is a lovely seasonal dish that's fresh and delicate. Note that there is no raw fish in this recipe; the word sushi simply denotes that a dish features seasoned rice, which can be served with a variety of accompaniments, including raw seafood. This type of sushi is called chirashi-sushi (chirashi means ""scattered""), and the rice is mixed with asparagus, thin strips of carrot, and cooked shrimp."

5018013~Carbonnade is the quintessential Belgian comfort food; this recipes caramelized onions, brown sugar, and brown beer make the sweet stew addictive. Chef Palombino also recommends making this carbonnade with any muscular cut of beef that's good for stewing, such as skirt and hanger steaks.
5018014~Like a potato-y flatbread and great topped with cured fish.
5018015~Highly recommended!
5018016~The tangy tomatillos are balanced by rich, buttery avocados. Serve with your favorite tortilla chips—and Margaritas.
5018017~As befitting a diner dessert, this ice cream is thick and rich and perfectly accents the apple tartlet. Cinnamon ice cream generally falls into three categories: infused via cinnamon sticks during the milk warming; ground cinnamon added during the milk warming; and ground cinnamon added at the very end. You can't get a real cinnamony flavor from the sticks alone, and adding ground cinnamon too early makes for a very strange texture. The third option lends a nice flavor and texture and leaves the custard pleasantly speckled.
5018100~Who knew Cabernet and cranberries would make such a dynamic duo? Add dried figs (plumped in the Cabernet ahead of time), and you end up with a winey, fruity fig bar, minus the cookie. This sauce is so fine, you'll be spooning leftovers on ice cream or slathering it on toast in place of jam. It's worth buying extra cranberries and freezing them so you can make more to last you through the winter.

5018028~Active time: 30 min Start to finish: 1 1/2 hr
5018029~Highly recommended!
5018030~The lamb that we buy today hardly requires a typical English mint sauce (the puckery flavor was originally designed to cut through the stronger taste of mutton), but the combination is by now a traditional and still-welcome one. Buttered carrots and a watercress salad would complement the lamb nicely. Uncork a full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon or red Bordeaux.
5018031~"This traditional recipe calls for pork confit, which you'll need to prepare at least two weeks before making the cassoulet. The confit adds undeniable richness and authenticity, but a simpler recipe (using country-style spareribs instead) appears in ""Top Trends: The Hot Ten"" in the January 2006 issue of Bon Appétit."
5018032~Buckles are aptly named: Fruit is baked along with a layer of cake batter that rises to the top, buckling as it cooks.

5018039~If you think brown rice isn't for you, think again. In particular, think about brown basmati rice, whose slender grains offer an inviting combination of elegance and earthy chew.

5018055~The two-pronged cooking method used for these wings —incorporating both braising and deep-frying — is a takeoff on the Chinese technique of steaming, then frying. We think it keeps the meat unbelievably tender while getting the skin supercrispy. Be sure to allow 2 hours for the wings to marinate.
5018056~Highly recommended!
5018057~"Sausage-wrapped ""Scotch"" eggs are a tasty and interesting dish when breaded and fried in the traditional manner, but cooking them on the smoker makes a very special treat. The homemade sausage gets a nice crust on the outside and, if you get it cooked just right, the egg yolk will have a little bit of ooze on the inside. Just make sure to seal the sausage all the way around the egg before smoking. I like to serve these as an appetizer, but they are also fine as a nice smoked addition to a lunch salad."

5018063~If it looks good at the market, it will be good in this salad.
5018064~"If you are the cook around the house, you know how sweet the words ""I love this. Please make it again!"" sound. This side has become my go-to dish for something quick and pretty, as I love the juxtaposition of the two shades of green. After you remove the leaves from the brussels sprouts, this takes only minutes to prepare. Brussels sprouts are miniature balls of cabbage, so their stems can be pretty tough. By working from the outermost leaf inward, and cutting more of the stem whenever necessary, you follow the pattern of the sprout to easily remove its leaves. You can do this part in advance, but you'll want to sauté them just before serving."
5018065~Because this dish was developed to complement the strong flavors of Pork Loin with Morel Stuffing, we kept the seasoning in these vegetables to a minimum. If you plan to serve this dish with simpler fare, you might want to increase the amount of garlic and herbs.

5018088~"I have lots of people asking me to create gluten-free recipes that do not just rely on the gluten-free flour that can be found in the shops. I have experimented with almond flour (ground almonds), but find that the resulting bakes can be quite heavy, which does not suit all baked goods, and also highly calorific. So while I use ground almonds in some things, I do like to use oats in others. The cinnamon in this recipe adds a lovely taste to the blueberries,
as well as helping regulate blood sugar levels."

5018100~Who knew Cabernet and cranberries would make such a dynamic duo? Add dried figs (plumped in the Cabernet ahead of time), and you end up with a winey, fruity fig bar, minus the cookie. This sauce is so fine, you'll be spooning leftovers on ice cream or slathering it on toast in place of jam. It's worth buying extra cranberries and freezing them so you can make more to last you through the winter.
5018101~Although major brands of crystallized ginger list only sugar and ginger in the ingredients, crystallized ginger cannot be purchased with kosher-for-Passover certification.

In this burger, I've spiced up the meat with thyme and Worcestershire sauce, which hint at the Mediterranean and at the steak house.

""I was in Los Angeles visiting my girlfriend, enjoying my favorite hangover drink, the Arnold Palmer, and watching an episode of Twin Peaks, where Leland Palmer almost whacks Agent Cooper with a golf club. Sometimes things just make sense,"" says Boelte. For his adult version of the popular drink that's half lemonade and half iced tea, Boelte combines gin, jasmine tea, limoncello, lemon juice, and grapefruit juice in a pitcher.

5018265~"In spite of my desire to never eat breaded chicken cutlets again, this was the first meal I ever made for Andy (at twenty-two, my meal repertoire was about as varied as my dad's) and in the years since, the chicken has proven to be a real lifesaver in the slap-it-together weeknight meal department. Plus, if you have this in your repertoire, you can make ""chicken pizza,"" chicken Milanese (just top with an arugula and tomato salad that has been tossed with oil and vinegar), and real chicken fingers."

5018270~Dark beer and molasses add rich depth of flavor to this moist and delicious cake.
5018271~Porrusalda
5018272~What to drink: Sparkling wine would pair well with these sweet-spicy flavors.
5018273~Ground cardamom is worth seeking out for this recipe — it adds another dimension to the dessert. The spice can be found at many supermarkets, Middle Eastern and Indian markets, and specialty foods shops.
5018274~Highly recommended!
5019950~Tired of potatoes? Try parsnips.
5018276~Chilly as July and August can be in San Francisco, you know it's summer when this delicious corn hits the Tacolicious menu. (It is so good that it transports you to sunshine, even if the city is socked in by fog and you're wearing a scarf.) If you already have the recado ready to go, this recipe is a cinch to make. Although the smokiness of the grill imparts great flavor, you can instead briefly boil the corn ears, halve them, and toss them with the recado-lime juice mixture. With the lime and the spices, no butter is needed. Try swapping out the corn for another vegetable, such as summer squash. To keep this recipe in the snack realm, chop the ears into thirds.
5018277~Highly recommended!
5018278~Serve these as an appetizer with a salad of baby greens.
5018279~Although the origins of spritz cookies are fuzzy—some say they come from Scandinavia, while others cite Germany—I'm inclined to believe it's the latter, because spritzen means to squirt in German, which is how these cookies are formed: The dough is squirted from a cookie press. You can make any shape you want, but we love these old-fashioned washboard strips. If the idea of yet another piece of kitchen equipment deters you, rest assured these cookies are so delicious, you'll be baking them more than once a year. A cookie press is not expensive and with all the different shapes you can make from the dough, it will more than pay for itself in fun and entertainment over the years for the child in all of us.
5018280~Highly recommended!
5018281~Serve with white rice to soak up the sweet and spicy sauce.
5018282~Creamy white beans, fresh basil, and crunchy young vegetables are combined in a light but substantial salad that takes advantage of the first fruits of the spring garden. Use a mild honey, like clover or wildflower. —Chef Sam
5018283~For a more elegant presentation, ask your butcher to french the rack of lamb (that is, trim the meat and fat from the ends of the bones). Also serve the Potato Silk with Truffle Oil and sautéed cherry tomatoes. A good Merlot is the perfect accompaniment.
5018284~If you can't find fresh chervil, use fresh parsley instead.

5018286~Wrapping salmon fillets in crespelle (crêpelike pasta) infused with fresh tarragon brings a mild herbal flavor to the fish and keeps the fillets moist. A lemon sauce adds another layer of sophistication.

5018297~This streamlined version of a favorite Malaysian street food noodle dish, char kway teow, substitutes Spanish chorizo for the Chinese sausage sometimes used. The smoked paprika that flavors the chorizo may be far from traditional, but it adds another layer of depth to this seductive stir-fry of rice noodles with shrimp, egg, and jicama. There's just enough chile paste for a mild buzz of heat, but not so much that your mouth is on fire.

5018300~"Eastern expert: Ming Tsai, chef-owner of Blue Ginger in Wellesley, Massachusetts, star and creator of the show East Meets West With Ming Tsai on the Food Network.

5018303~Chickpea fritters laced with rosemary are common in parts of France and Italy. For a terrific side dish that serves eight, top these latkes with a quick sauce made by stirring two tablespoons dried mint into one cup plain yogurt, and offer with fish. Or drizzle the latkes with pomegranate molasses (found at Middle Eastern markets and some supermarkets), and serve with meat or poultry.
5018304~This dessert has a silky texture and intense flavors. Begin preparing it a day ahead.
5018305~Supermarkets, as well as butcher shops, sell a variety of chicken sausage — just use your favorite.
5018306~"When Roy Yamaguchi invited me to cook at the 5th Anniversary celebration of his Oahu restaurant, I wanted to bring him something special from my neck of the woods and decided to attempt to transport soft-shelled crabs. I say ""attempt"" because soft-shells are very delicate and I wasn't sure they'd survive the long trip to Hawaii. Happily, of the 10 dozen live ones we packed up, about 8 dozen were still kicking when we got to our destination. I served them with simple accompaniments like wilted spinach and a crushed summer tomato vinaigrette."
5018307~Highly recommended!
5018308~Mangoes are used two ways in this Indian dish — grilled with the chicken and tossed into rice.
5018309~Pea pesto is a condiment, a sauce, a flavor enhancer. I spread it on grilled skirt steak marinated in horseradish and on lamb chops. I sauce spaghettini with pea pesto (just boil the pasta in chicken stock and toss in the pea pesto and garnish with toasted breadcrumbs) and I dress cold roast chicken with pea pesto and homemade yogurt. I broil or grill seafood skewers and serve them on a pillow of pea pesto; I sauté scallops or swordfish in the pan with pea pesto; and serve poached eggs on an English muffin spread with pea pesto. For extra zing, you can add a tablespoon of horseradish to every cup of peas.
5018310~The tender texture of these cake doughnuts comes from folding in the dry ingredients gently by hand, rather than beating them in with a mixer.
5018311~The pears give this pretty pizza fresh flavor and texture.

5018315~You’ll notice there’s no triple sec. Trust us, it’s better this way.
5018316~You'll make more dressing than you need for one batch of salad with this recipe, but that's a good thing—you'll want to keep using it on all your salads all week.
5018317~So good — and no cooking required. Prepare the relish at least a day ahead, and add more cardamom before serving if you'd like a stronger flavor.
5018318~Highly recommended!
5018319~Candy corn may be synonymous with Halloween, but come on, how many of us really love the chewy little tooth-shaped candies with a flavor that is indistinguishable beyond sweet? However, if you borrow their iconic shape and colors and transform those into creamy lemon-and-orange frozen pops, we predict everyone will be clamoring for their fair share.
5018320~Baby artichokes are much easier to prepare than the large ones, as they can be eaten choke and all. For ease of serving, these vegetables may be tossed with the roasted potatoes (see Green Olive, Lemon and Garlic-Roasted Leg of Lamb with Potatoes and Pan Gravy ) for a delicious all-in-one side dish.
5018321~This sophisticated dessert makes the most of contrasting textures. The subtle floral flavor of wildflower honey connects all of the components.
5018322~Highly recommended!

5018330~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018331~If you are using a single 12-inch nonstick skillet for this recipe, make the red cabbage and onions first. Transfer to a heated serving bowl and cover to keep warm, then clean skillet and cook salmon.
5018332~That's right, schmaltz oatmeal cookies. We had to have something sweet! The schmaltz does have a great effect here—it doesn't make the cookie taste like chicken, but it does give it a savory depth to balance the sweetness. So using schmaltz in a cookie turns out to be a fascinating and useful example of balancing sweet with a savory ingredient. I love the tart, dense dried cherries in these cookies, but this recipe is a great all-purpose vehicle for whatever garnish you want to give them—raisins, dried cranberries, walnuts, pecans or a mixture of any or all of the above.
5018333~This apple pandowdy recipe is so delicious that we're just going to have to say: Cobbler, you’ve been warned.
5018334~With a little planning, this addictive treat can be easily thrown together at the last minute. Infuse the honey up to 24 hours in advance and arrange the blue cheese on crackers several hours ahead of time. Then, just before serving, drizzle with honey and sprinkle with scallions.
5018335~Head to a local Chinese supermarket for the ginger in syrup and, while you're there, pick up a package of glass or cellophane noodles to serve this with. Tangy ginger and flavorful hoisin work so well with duck. Make sure you render the duck breasts well when cooking to get that ultimate crispy skin.

5018337~Egg whites are shaken into this gin-based sour, where they take on an airy, velvety texture.

5018350~The Lime Mojo (a sauce of olive oil, chilies, garlic and spices) provides a spicy, tangy counterpoint to the pork. Serve the Spiced Butternut Squash and the Corn and Cheese Arepas (see recipes) as side dishes, and pour a Zinfandel or dark beer. Begin preparing the pork a day ahead.
5018351~"Garcia likes making this bread pudding because ""we buy wonderful rustic Italian loaves for the restaurant that are just too good to waste,"" she says."
5018352~Though the truffles lend a wonderfully rich flavor to the shrimp, they are fairly costly, so you might want to save this dish for special occasions.
5018353~"Editor's note: In addition to the Mexican crema , Castro also recommends serving these tamales with Creamy Salsa Verde and Chipotle Chile Sauce
While tamales are one of Mexico's most famous street foods, they are also one of its most popular party foods, which is fitting since a tamal is packaged like a small gift waiting to be unwrapped. The many steps involved in tamal making have discouraged countless cooks. But they should not, because the process is very easy. And if you gather a few friends to help with the assembling, you can have a tamal-making party before the real party begins."
5018354~You can freeze the dough flavored or unflavored, in logs or not—for up to two weeks.
5018355~Make a salad of rice tossed with diced jicama, red bell pepper, avocado and a vinaigrette dressing, and pass bowls of sour cream and shredded lettuce to accompany these Southwest-style meatless bean burgers. A lemon tart is a perfect finale.
5018356~Whether you call this dish a chili or hearty chicken and bean stew, it's definitely a winner. The first time I made it for my kids, they asked me so many times what it was called, but by the end of the meal they cared much more about getting second helpings than remembering the name! If you have time be sure to double the recipe and store in the fridge or freezer, because, like most soups and stews, the leftovers are amazing.
5018357~Highly recommended!
5018358~This hearty stew was inspired by the flavors of Spain and Portugal. Because it can be made ahead, it's a perfect dish to enjoy after a day of skiing or other winter play. Offer the stew with some crusty bread and a chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Follow with the curly endive salad. For dessert, serve a seasonal fruit tart from your favorite bakery.
5018359~Purée de Carottes et Pommes de Terre
5018360~Baking the potatoes first gives them a nice creamy texture. The potency of the mustard will diminish as the potatoes are being stirred over the burner; so if you really want to feel the burn, add an extra teaspoon or so of mustard just before serving.
5018361~(Chipotle-Marinated Grilled Pork Ribs)
5018362~"This tropical twist on the French classic moules marinières serves up briny mussels in a tangy coconut broth enhanced by ginger and lemongrass. You'll find the pretty green stalks of fresh lemongrass in the produce section of many fine supermarkets and specialty-food shops, alongside the brown knobby fresh ginger rhizomes, or roots. Both aromatics need to be peeled before using, and both have dense, stringy flesh that can be difficult to mince. Grating is a good solution for ginger; include the juices that are extruded when you scrape. For lemongrass, peel and use only the tender midsection of the slender, bulblike stalk. Smash it with the flat side of a chef's knife to make mincing easier.
Increase your dining pleasure by sipping, as an accompaniment, any bright, fresh white wine that offers good acidity. Think sparkling wine, unoaked Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, or Sauvignon Blanc."
5018363~Inspired by the simple cherry desserts from the Limousin region of France, this baked custard can be served warm or at room temperature. Feel free to use pitted or unpitted cherries.
5018364~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018365~Highly recommended!
5018366~This cheesy, spicy flatbread is completely irresistible. Cook it on the grill until just lightly charred, and serve with ribs—it's great for mopping up all the delicious sauce.

5018370~This moist spoon bread (a pudding-like bread made with cornmeal) tastes best warm.

5018383~This tsimmes created by Chef Lenard Rubin of the Phoenician Club in Phoenix, Arizona, is so good that I sometimes serve it alone without stuffing it into the chilies.
5018384~Gael Greene shared these recipes with Epicurious from her new book, Insatiable.
5018385~Inspired by a cocktail from New York City bartender Natasha David, the crimson-colored Tarocco Spritz is a nod to the flavor and color of the Sicilian Tarocco orange, often referred to as the “half-blood orange.” A mixed-heritage cocktail, this drink has a bumped-up base of gin to match the vibrant bitter aperitivo liqueur Cappelletti. The drink’s acidity comes courtesy of blood orange, lemon juice, and prosecco, bound together by the unlikely addition of vanilla, which complements Cappelletti’s notes of spice and oxidation.
5018386~The vegetables can be prepared ahead and finished up to the middle of step 3. Heat for 5 minutes before serving.
5018387~Fresh mint and lime juice add a bright finish to this drink.
5018388~Thai red curry paste, unsweetened coconut milk, and fish sauce are available in the Asian foods section of most supermarkets. Serve this curry over steamed jasmine rice.
5018389~Apples are traditional, but peaches are divine.
5018390~The honey makes these delicate cookies light and crisp. Offer them with Vin Santo (an Italian dessert wine made from dried Malvasia and Trebbiano grapes), cream Sherry, Port or Sauternes.
5018391~The gravy can be started while the turkey roasts. When the turkey is through cooking, finish the gravy with balsamic vinegar and the pan juices.
5018392~Beautiful, impressive and filled with flavor.
5018393~This high-summer salad hits every note on the sweet (red pepper), sour (tomato), salty (ricotta and anchovy), and bitter (olive) scale.
5018394~Pair this summery side dish with grilled pork chops or flank steak, or chop and fold it into couscous for a light meal.
5018395~Why serve plain iced tea when you can punch it up with healthy, natural flavors like ginger, mint, lemon and peach, as in Bonaparte's version here? A good reason to steep and sip: Tea's polyphenols may lower your risk for cancer.
5018396~The dates act as both a sweetener and an emulsifier in this citrusy, mustardy vinaigrette.
5018397~Pasta in the Greek style, with an added surprise: parsnips.
5018398~Letting the roast sit at room temperature will help it cook more evenly; starting it at a higher temperature jump-starts the browning process.
5018399~Sole amandine is a classic preparation for the delicate fish, pairing it with toasty almonds and a lemon butter sauce. Lightly cooked Brussels sprouts add texture.
5018400~Elote Asado
5018401~"This is like a frozen mousse, which helps explain its name: semifreddo, or ""half-frozen."" Start preparation a day ahead."
5018402~Pastry chef Mathew Rice uses flavors from his childhood as inspiration for his desserts. Here, pears and buttermilk cake are transformed with thyme, lemon, and crème fraîche. And the ice cream? A very grown-up Greek yogurt.
5018403~Highly recommended!
5018404~They look like sticky buns, but these sweet, gooey treats are actually made from biscuit batter. They're great with brunch.
5018405~Highly recommended!
5018406~Saffron gives the couscous a gorgeous yellow color.
5018407~Puff pastry as strudel dough is even faster and more convenient than phyllo dough. A scoop of vanilla ice cream or frozen vanilla yogurt is great alongside.
5018408~This recipe is an accompaniment for Master Stock Chicken .
5018409~Marinate the steaks one to eight hours before grilling. What to drink: A red wine with ripe fruit (such as Côtes du Rhône) or a pale ale.
5018410~Lamb is a classic at Easter, particularly leg of lamb. Increasingly, though, lamb legs are sold boned, or even better, boned and butterflied, which makes them ideal for summer grilling. But for Easter, a boneless lamb leg (readily available at the big-box stores) becomes something irresistible to stuff, and because there's no bone, it's a dream to carve.
5018411~"A ""skinny"" version that features nonfat yogurt and light mayonnaise in the dressing. Lemon peel and celery seeds add zip. Try with grilled steak, chicken, or salmon."
5018412~Meat-free but not too virtuous, it's healthy and satisfying.
5018413~The broccoli gives bright flavor and color to this easy vegetarian pasta dish.
5018414~"""During a recent business trip to Birmingham, Alabama, I had dinner at the Hot and Hot Fish Club,"" writes Shelia Murray of Paradise, California. ""Every bite of chef Chris Hasting's shrimp and grits was packed with flavor. I'd love to prepare this stand-out dish at home."""
5018415~Salmon fillets can be substituted for the char. For a shortcut version of the horseradish cream, just mix 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream with prepared white horseradish to taste.
5018416~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less, but requires additional unattended time.

5018421~We enjoyed this dish served at room temperature, but it is also delicious warm.
5018422~Choose the largest and broadest carrots and parsnips among those available at the store; smaller, more slender ones won't form large enough strips to be fruitful for frying. These have a light and delicate crunch and natural sweetness that make for an interesting change of pace from the traditional potato chip.
5018423~Pancetta, the salty Italian bacon, forms a crust around the chicken. Offer a bottle of Pinot Grigio, a crisp Italian white wine, with this entrée. For dessert, try spumoni and sugar cookies.
5018424~Active time: 40 min Start to finish: 50 min
5018425~Erisheris are thick curries traditionally made with yams or pumpkin, toasted coconut, and whole kidney beans. They are hearty and earthy, with a tropical twist of coconut and curry leaves.

5018438~This is the easy way to make ginger beer, where the ginger is simply soaked — just slightly fermented — for 24 hours (another method requires up to a five-day fermentation). Ginger beer is one of Jamaica's most popular soft drinks and is sold practically everywhere, from the supermarket to roadside stands.
5018439~These truffles have a double dose of mint in the form of fresh mint leaves and Vandermint, a Dutch chocolate-mint liqueur.
5018440~Highly recommended!
5018441~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018442~What's the secret to a good soufflé? Beating the egg whites with the sugar until they are stiff and still very shiny, then folding them into the flavor base carefully in two or three additions so that the whites do not deflate. This dessert has an intense tangerine flavor, which comes from using the entire fruit, except for its seeds, of course. Any leftover tangerine syrup can be added to sparkling wine to make a mimosa with a twist.
5018443~Our food editors agree that this is one of the best-tasting and most elegant shepherd's pies they've ever had. The recipe is not as complicated as it appears at first glance—the different components all come together to make a complete meal in a single dish. The potatoes are stiffer than the average mash because they will be forming the crust for the pie.
5018444~Juicy chicken cutlets with all the bright, briny flavors of classic piccata are possible without a stove—all you need is a microwave.
5018445~Active time: 15 min Start to finish: 45 min

5018474~Migas is the name of a popular Spanish starter of breadcrumbs fried with ham; it's typically served with fried eggs. Here, migas becomes a crouton topping for the salad.

5018484~Everyone wants the juiciest turkey possible for Thanksgiving, and we find that brined or kosher turkeys are best for this. If you'd like to try brining, stir together 8 quarts water with 2 cups kosher salt in a 5-gallon bucket lined with a large heavy-duty plastic garbage bag, then soak raw turkey, covered and chilled, 10 hours. (Kosher turkeys, which are salted during the koshering process, are just as succulent and flavorful as brined ones.) If you are making this entire menu in a single oven, bake the stuffing and sweet potatoes and reheat the potato parsnip purée while the turkey stands after roasting.
5018485~Cold cooked rice (made at least 1 day ahead) is the secret to delicious fried rice, so don't cook a fresh pot for this recipe.
5018486~What to drink: Red wine that's both earthy and light — try a northern Rhône Syrah blend like Saint-Joseph.
5018487~Dashi is a subtly flavored soup stock that is used throughout Japanese cooking.
5018488~In a classic pairing, tarragon brightens up chicken for spring. Serve with steamed rice to soak up the luscious sauce.
5018489~These vegan brownies took at least thirty rounds of serious test-kitchen madness (not kidding!). When we finally said, okay, okay, moist and crumbly and chocolatey and delicious, we gave in. I used flaxseed meal and warm water to create a binder that replaces the need for egg. These egg-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, guilt-free brownies are some of the best you will ever taste! They will crumble a bit more than regular brownies, so beware of crumbs!
5018490~This light, tangy yogurt accompaniment wakes up any dish. You can swap in one 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach for the fresh; just thaw and squeeze well before stirring into yogurt.

5018501~"""My husband and I celebrated my fiftieth birthday on the island of St. John, where we enjoyed many terrific meals,"" says Eileen Hruby of Tom's River, NJ. ""One day, we had lunch at Pusser's Ltd. in Cruz Bay. The coleslaw they served was extraordinary: cool and hot at the same time. I have no idea how it was made."""
5018502~There is no USDA data for water bath canning artichokes. I developed this recipe, which has a pH of 3.5, well within the safety limits for water bath canning. The processing time is based on the recommended time for marinated peppers, which contain similar quantities of olive oil—an important consideration when water bath processing foods.
5018503~Serve a dry Riesling to complement the subtle ginger flavor of the roasted chicken.

5019065~Vanilla sugar keeps indefinitely and is wonderful sprinkled over French toast or on berries. It can also be used in place of sugar and vanilla extract when baking. You can add more sugar to the container and the bean will continue to infuse it.
5018517~I think we all play favorites in the kitchen; I know I do. One day I am all over my Tahini-Lemon-Yogurt Dressing, dreaming up salads and dishes that would marry well with its salty tang. Then, suddenly, I abandon it in favor of another dressing and another direction. At this writing, this is my most loved dressing, and I drizzle it on everything I can get my hands on!

5018523~Vinegar, soy, Sherry, and maple syrup create a wonderfully balanced glaze for this mackerel; it takes on a beautiful caramel sheen during cooking.
5018524~Filled with spices, buttermilk, and jam, this moist cake has been in the baking repertoire of my husband's family for over a century. Although this particular recipe hails from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I found many other recipes for jam cake that originated further south. At first glance, I mistakenly thought the jam was merely a filling between the cake layers but to my happy surprise, the jam is actually an ingredient in the batter, creating a lovely berry hue to the cake and an even better berry taste. This down-home cake traditionally calls for a sweet caramel frosting, but I opted for a decadent caramel chocolate ganache. Make the ganache before you make the cake as it needs about 3 hours to firm up at room temperature (and is so much better when not refrigerated).
5018525~While this impressive roast cooks, it slowly transfers flavorful juices to the moist potato-and-onion stuffing tucked inside. Once the breast has been cut from the bone, it yields beautiful slices ideal for drizzling with the lush pan sauce.
5018526~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018527~Boxed spice cake never tasted so good: Fresh pears, crystallized ginger and a sweet nut topping really perk it up. Serve this warm or at room temperature. The topping will be soft when warm; it will be firmer, like southern praline, when cool.
5018528~The secret to this healthy dish's deceptively rich taste? Cheeses that are loaded with flavor but light on fat. Chef Gonzalo Mendoza further reduces the fat content by lining the pan with thinly sliced potatoes instead of piecrust (which typically contains a lot of butter or lard) for a big fat-calorie savings. The spinach, tomatoes, and onion add nearly 8 grams of fiber to every hearty slice.
5018529~This recipe, from nutritionist Karen Fisher at Deerfield Spa, provides ideal amounts of carbs, fat and protein. If you're going to be active, simply add 1/2 cup more pasta.
5018530~If you haven't already made the low-fat buttermilk dressing for the buffalo burgers you'll need to allow a little extra time for this recipe.
5018531~Sofrito is a sautéed vegetable mixture used as a seasoning in much of Latin America and the Caribbean. It typically contains garlic, onion, bell pepper, coriander, and sometimes tomatoes or ham, although the recipe varies among countries. In our version, we've omitted the oil normally used to cook the ingredients and instead simply puréed the vegetables.
5018532~This dish is best eaten right away. You can make all the parts — except for the pasta — way ahead of time and just throw it together at the last minute. (The slow-roasted tomatoes are also great in other roles — as part of an antipasto in the summertime, as an omelet filling, or as a topping on grilled bread.)
5018533~Active time: 40 min Start to finish: 50 min
5018534~Highly recommended!
5018535~"Few ingredients, big payoff: Large ""steaks"" are cut from a head of cauliflower, sautéed until golden, then baked until tender. They're served over a simple puree made from the cauliflower florets. An impressive first course, this can also be a lovely side. Just sear two mahi-mahi fillets in butter and place them alongside the cauliflower."
5018536~Freeze some of this sauce now and treat yourself to a burst of summer one cold, wintry day.
5018537~Peach lattice is a beautifully classic summer pie. A drizzling of rich, buttery bourbon caramel over each slice heightens the naturally lush sweetness of ripe peaches.
5018538~You may never go back to roast beef sandwiches after trying the bold flavor of steak with creamy, garlicky Boursin.
5018539~Lots of garlic adds great flavor to this dish. At the restaurant they make it with spinach pappardelle, but fettuccine is a convenient substitution.
5018540~This is a great way to use up leftover roasted vegetables and chicken and turn them into a light salad. The roasted veggies are more interesting the second time around in a vinaigrette as opposed to just on their own. Even when I don't have leftover roasted veggies, I have been known to toss some raw ones in the oven just to make this delicious dressing, which I eat on everything: pasta, grilled fish, and, obviously, chicken. The chicken for this salad can be warm or cold, straight from the fridge.

5018546~"•Look for a sharp, white Cheddar that is on the dry side, such as English Wensleydale Farmhouse Truckle or Extra Old Black Diamond Cheddar.
•It's important not to whip air into the dough — simply mix until blended."
5018547~There are hundreds, if not thousands, of barbecue chicken recipes out there, and we've certainly had our share, so we can say with authority that this spicy sweet-and-sour grilled chicken is the best we've had to date. It's got enough heat to titillate your taste buds, but not so much that kids will steer clear. The additions of tomato paste and soy sauce provide deep, dark, low notes that keep the sauce from squealing. In other words, it's heat with harmony.
5018548~The lighter, herbier counterpart to porky posole rojo, this brothy stew was made for crisp autumn nights.
5018549~Start with Belgian endive spears filled with caviar of red salmon, golden whitefish or black lumpfish. Serve with your favorite Champagne or Chardonnay.
5018550~Mashed potatoes take on a new form in this delicious dish. A mixture of mashed potatoes and wilted kale is shaped into patties and pan-fried, then paired with a dressed-up mayo. Serve as a first course or with a salad for a light lunch.
5018825~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018552~"""The Indians and English use them much,"" wrote one visitor to New England in 1663, ""boyling them with Sugar for Sauce to eat with their Meat, and it is a delicate Sauce."" Although there is little evidence that cranberry sauce was served at the first Thanksgiving, it is assumed that Indians brought it to the feast. This tangy version gets its intense flavor and color from a mixture of fresh and dried cranberries, along with frozen cranberry juice cocktail concentrate."
5018553~Highly recommended!
5018554~Roasting the pork at a low temperature in a spiced salt mixture amps up the flavor of the meat and makes it extra-tender. After cooking the pork, the rack of bones is cut off and used to hold the roast for easy carving.
5018555~We got the idea for these pancakes from The Compound Restaurant in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where hot polenta-mascarpone pancakes were the perfect finale to a delicious dinner. They also make a terrific breakfast.

5018565~Kebabs are not only fun to eat, they also save time: It takes less than 10 minutes for these lamb cubes to cook up medium-rare. The marinade, made with fresh thyme and rosemary, infuses both the meat and the vegetables with south-of-France flavor.
5018566~Yes, there is butter in the sauce, but the key ingredient is verjus. If you can't find it, use half white wine and half unseasoned rice vinegar.
5018567~Round out your breakfast: Add 1 cup steamed skim milk (heat on stove or in microwave until milk starts to froth) topped with 2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp honey.
5018568~A flavorful accompaniment for roast pork, chicken, burgers, or grilled shrimp.
5018569~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.

5018571~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018572~A simple version of a Scandinavian fruit soup. This can also be served as a sauce over ice cream, frozen yogurt or pudding.
5018573~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5018574~This autumnal dish is especially appropriate and welcome as the first course on a cool fall evening. The subtle sweetness of the squash is enhanced by the flavors of the pears, orange, and ginger, making it a great addition also to the Thanksgiving Table.
5018575~Highly recommended!
5019779~Don't be surprised if you're asked for this recipe again and again — these shrimp are an absolute knockout. The bright acidity of the marinade and the crispness of fennel, celery, and onion are a delicious counterpoint to the sweetness of the shrimp.
5018577~Highly recommended!
5018578~In this version of chips and dip—an essential snack food—making your own onion dip (spiked with chipotle chiles) really ups the ante. Homemade pita chips flavored with garlic come together quickly and are so much better than anything you'll find in the chip aisle.

5018588~This cake is the little black dress of fiber — velvety and sophisticated. Medjool dates lend it an unbelievably unctuous texture. When measuring spelt flour, be sure to spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off to prevent packing it down; this will keep the cake light.

5018592~"When working with big flavors, you don't need big quantities. ""There's something to be said for restraint,"" says chef Chris Kuziemko of Chicago's Publican Quality Meats, a butcher shop that uses house-cured meat to make incredible sandwiches. Take his lead and swap the grocery store cold cuts for a special cured meat like soppressata or prosciutto, and indulge in a quality cheese. You'll build something beautiful without having to supersize. Just be sure to balance all the bold notes: In this pulled-back panino, Kuziemko uses a sharp provolone to cut the fat and the slightly sweet flavor of the coppa, and honey to temper the spicy-bitter broccoli rabe pesto. Because when no single ingredient dominates, each one can shine."
5018593~Cèpes (also known as porcini) are perfect with roast duck. Pair this dinner-partyworthy dish with a New Zealand Pinot Noir.
5018594~Also known as advieh, this aromatic blend comes from Persian cuisine. It’s fragrant, a little sweet, and gently warming. It is delicious mixed with sugar and sprinkled over baked goods, donuts, and rice pudding or added to dried fruits that are cooking into jam. It straddles the sweet and savory world because it’s also great for flavoring rice pilaf with toasted nuts, lentil soup, lamb meatballs, braised chicken, or vegetable stew. It’s a blend that is shared by chefs and pastry chefs. Use it to make Persian-Style Carrots and Black-Eyed Peas.
5018595~Highly recommended!
5018596~The crumble is the British version of the American crisp. This one features the classic combination of tart rhubarb and sweet strawberries, topped with a crunchy oat-and-hazelnut streusel. A scoop of ice cream is the perfect finishing touch.

5018603~Think meatless has to mean boring? These delicious patties, made with earthy portabella mushrooms and hearty kasha, defy the bland reputation of vegetarian burgers. A fiery dollop of chipotle mayonnaise makes them even more irresistible.
5019606~Refreshing and a little bit inebriating; if you've got kids running around, pick up a box of Rocket Pops so there's no confusion!

5018608~This sauce adds a nice kick to Shabu-Shabu. Use it as you would wasabi in sushi restaurants.
5018609~Using lamb slashes fat; mixing a milk-soaked pita into the patty keeps it moist.
5018610~"Caldo verde means ""green broth"" in Portuguese, and it is Portugal's unofficial national dish. This beautiful green soup is technically a hot smoothie, since its many nutritious greens are pureed together in a blender. Chickpeas are an important ingredient here, too. Fiber- and protein-rich, they've been shown in studies to help people lose weight. For added protein, top with 4 ounces of shredded chicken or add 2 dozen clams to the broth."
5018611~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5018612~If you're making these sweets for your kids, remember that chocolate (raw chocolate in particular) can be somewhat stimulating. To avoid turning bedtime into party time, it's safer to make these a daytime snack.

5018625~This aromatic alternative to pumpkin pie calls for fresh (not canned!) squash and a new twist on the classic crumble topping. If you'd like some sparkle on the edge of your crust, brush it with a beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar before baking.

5018627~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018628~The following tsimmes with beets, turnips, carrots, and meat came from Vilna to Brooklyn earlier in this century. When I make this for my family I do not tell the children that it includes beets and turnips. For some unknown reason they never ask me how the dish became so red. They love it.

5018659~You can toast nuts in the oven or in a skillet. The toasting time will vary depending on the size of the nuts. Larger nuts, such as walnuts, pecans, or almonds take longer than smaller nuts such as peanuts, pine nuts, or macadamia nuts. Once cool, store them in an airtight container.
5018660~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018661~This glaze also makes for an addictive tray of chicken wings. Use the same weight and method as for the ribs, but reduce final cooking time by 10 minutes.
5018662~These easy enchiladas have a bright, lively flavor thanks to lots of tomatillos, fresh herbs, and two kinds of chiles.
5018663~A delicious new take on an old favorite.
5018664~"The sauce known as all'arrabbiata—or ""in the angry style""—is made with hot red pepper flakes (and sometimes fresh chilies for an extra kick). I like to use the briny elements of olives and capers and skip the fresh chilies, adding depth to the spiciness rather than just more heat. Perfect with penne or rigatoni."
5018665~While the turkey roasts, it releases tons of concentrated flavor into the pan—this is where the gravy takes on another dimension. As the bird rests, set the pan on your stovetop, roll up your sleeves, and get to work.
5018666~These pretty tartlets can be made one day ahead. Arrange them in a single layer in a shallow plastic container for transporting.
5018667~Use canned beets to cut the preparation time of this colorful salad.
5018668~Tofu is frequently paired with Asian flavors, but here it is a delicate canvas for a robust, creamy French-inspired dressing that also gussies up the seasonal side salad. Dipping the tofu in egg before it hits the skillet seals its custardy texture inside a lovely golden crust.
5018669~This refreshing summer salsa gets some heat from serrano chile.
5018670~Brining the chops makes them moist.
5018671~Give Swiss chard a flavor boost by adding whole chopped lemon instead of just the juice. Simmering it first softens the texture and bitter undertones. Serve this dish with Red Quinoa with Pistachios .
5018672~In Puerto Rico, as Christmas Eve approaches, groups of carolers playing the güiro (a percussion instrument made from a gourd), the cuatro (a four-stringed guitar), and maracas visit friends and neighbors, asking for food and drink.

5018686~You don’t have to book a reservation at your favorite seafood house to dig into flaky crab cakes—just make these simple ones in your broiler at home! Crab is an overlooked superfood, low in calories and high in complete protein, vitamin B12, and zinc, all key building blocks of your body and brain. Flaxseeds and hemp seeds bring in fiber and protein, so you stay full longer. If you spy reddish microgreens or fresh nasturtiums at your local farmers’ market, they will make lovely garnishes for this gourmet meal and add a spicy note.
5018687~Bagna cauda is a warm, garlicky dip traditionally served with raw vegetables. It hails from northwestern Italy's Piedmont region. In this version, the sauce is served with cooked artichokes. And dont be scared off by the three heads of garlic called for in this recipe. Simmering the garlic mellows its flavor significantly.
5018688~"Arab salad, chopped salad, Israeli salad—whatever you choose to call it, there is no escaping it. Wherever you go, a Jerusalemite is most likely to have a plate of freshly chopped vegetables—tomato, cucumber, and onion, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice—served next to whatever else they are having. It's a local affliction, quite seriously. Friends visiting us in London always complain of feeling they ate ""unhealthily"" because there wasn't a fresh salad served with every meal."
5018689~Present the turkey before carving it. I suggest garnishing it with fresh sage and kumquats.
5019572~Shawarma is the Middle Eastern version of a large vertical shish kebab known as doner kebab in Turkey and gyro in Greece. It's made by impaling layers of meat on an oversize spit with a flat base and roasting the meat in an upright rotisserie. There are at least three advantages to this singular method of cooking. The dripping fat bastes the meat below it; the meat is sliced to order (at least it should be) from the outside, which gives every customer a crusty end cut; and because the crusty meat slices are piled on pita bread with fresh vegetables, pickles, and tahini sauce, you get a whole meal—and a healthful one—in a single sandwich. Traditionally, shawarma was made with lamb, but more and more Israeli grill masters use thinly sliced chicken or turkey. Shawarma is easy to prepare if you have a vertical rotisserie, and somewhat more challenging to adapt to the home grill. But direct-grilling the turkey slices does give you a close approximation of the taste and texture of classic shawarma.

5018707~Think of this as a streamlined and guilt-free version of scalloped potatoes. It's a toss-and-dump dish, in which I toss sliced potatoes with a little melted butter, dump them in a dish, then cover them with milk—healthier than heavy cream—that I've thickened slightly with a bit of flour (the flour keeps the milk from separating). The cheese topping is optional; with or without it, in less than an hour you will be rewarded with lusciously creamy potatoes along with that all-important browned crust.

5018711~Ever wonder how soybeans turn into smooth, creamy tofu? First, the beans are pressed to extract soy milk, which is then curdled. The curds are drained, pressed, and cut into blocks of tofu.
5018712~The salmon can be grilled two ways. The first method requires a fish-grilling basket, which can be found at many cookware and barbecue stores (use one that's about 18 by 6 inches for this recipe). The second technique doesn't call for any special equipment at all — just a rimless baking sheet and a spatula.
5018713~Thanks to a few humble additions—sun-dried tomatoes, sweet smoked paprika, and leafy spinach—these saucy beans have real pizzazz. Best of all, the dish requires little more than a quick sauté and simmer.

A garlicky rouille, exotic with a touch of crumbled saffron, further coaxes out the natural richness of the fish.

And we found the savory, juicy meat (simmered with blood-orange preserves and apricots) and the spiced toasted pine nuts to be an absolutely delicious combination."
5018804~Preserving a Meyer lemon captures its glorious perfume. We’ve adapted cookbook author Paula Wolfert’s quick method, our favorite, and made it even faster by blanching the lemons first.

5018817~If you have never thought to boil a turkey, this 1623 recipe will make a believer out of you. While the original recipe calls for a whole bird, the modern recipe is adapted to use with prepackaged turkey pieces. If you would like use a small whole bird (10-12 pounds), cut it into ten pieces before boiling—it is really difficult and potentially dangerous to lift a whole steaming turkey from a pot of boiling broth. For this larger amount of turkey, you will need to double the other ingredients.

5018822~I like this one because it's a one-pan dish—you will need a pan with a lid. You can use a can of tomatoes instead of making the purée if you wish, but puréeing the tomatoes produces a better result. You don't need to be precise with the quantities for this dish at all—a handful of cherry tomatoes, add some onion, etc. The important thing is to have the lid to keep in steam and heat so you get a very nice lightly cooked fish. You don't want to overcook it. I've used hake but you can use any white fish like cod, sea bass, halibut or even salmon. It's simple but tasty, and the kind of thing you could easily rustle up for yourself or friends. You can use any green veg but it works well with fennel—sautéed in a pan or slow-baked, or added to the pan and cooked with the fish and tomatoes. This is a great one for a novice cook.

5018873~Here's another dessert that was inspired by a wine-tasting dinner. It's often hard to come up with a dessert that pairs well with wine, but this savory-sweet dessert does. At its center is a Seckel pear, a small, reddish pear with a slightly spicy flavor. It has a firm flesh that makes it perfect for poaching. In this dessert I poach the pears in pomegranate juice with some ground black pepper. A chunk of Cabrales cheese, a strong blue cheese from northern Spain, is sandwiched between the top and bottom halves of the pear, and a Szechuan Ice Cream is served with it, sitting on a diamond of baked almond cream.

5018890~These tacos don't come from a particular town or restaurant; rather, they incorporate elements from many different Yucatán grill masters. The preparation may look complicated, but it's actually pretty easy—because your guests assemble the tacos themselves.
5018891~Highly recommended!
5018892~Why make a single bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich when you can bake a big dish for a crowd? A glaze of bacon fat across the top adds an extra salty-smoky punch, and a quick trip under the broiler makes the top extra crispy.
5018893~When overlapping the phyllo over the filling in this recipe, work carefully but quickly so the phyllo doesn’t dry out before baking.
5018894~Biscochitos are the best thing to get with your coffee when you eat breakfast at a Mexican bakery. Mi Tierra makes my favorite version of these rich Mexican cookies. Sorry, there is no substitute for the lard—it's the secret ingredient!
5018895~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018896~"""I developed this recipe last winter and think it makes excellent cold-weather fare,"" says Lora Anderson of Cincinnati, Ohio."
5018897~A traditional highball drink that's very low in sugar, it's also incredibly popular at soda fountains sans alcohol. The lime and bitters are a great pairing with the naturally sweet coconut water.
5018898~As these little chocolate-dipped cookies bake, they fall and spread somewhat, so they won't be as tall as when first piped onto the baking sheets.

But my sons — Sammy, two, and Weston, four — keep me moving the most, which has changed my cooking style. In fact, a friend and fellow mom had a great idea for a cookbook that she wants me to help her write. We would call it The One-Arm Gourmet, and it would be filled with quick dishes you can make while holding a kid in one arm and cooking with the other. """

5018907~Here's a fresh take on the classic combination of fruit and cheese. Placing parchment on top of the pears as they are poaching helps keep them moist and submerged in the poaching liquid.
5018908~Because it's often the first dessert a child is allowed to eat, rice pudding can conjure up wonderful memories, which may be why it continues to be a favorite of a lot of grown-ups. Pure maple syrup sweetens the pudding, which develops a smooth golden topping as it bakes.
5018909~The liquid is really up to you. Nut milks add body and protein, but if you prefer something sweeter, try juice. Less heavy? Go with coconut water.

5018911~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018912~When there is a whole lamb on the Arab table, the occasion is a special one. It is prepared to celebrate the birth of a child, a marriage, the return from a pilgrimage, or the recuperation from illness. For the host, it is an opportunity to honor the guests, showing them how important they are. When I was growing up, my mother always prepared it for the Eid al Adha, the celebration for the end of the pilgrimage to Mecca.
5018913~Potato gratin is, of course, the traditional side dish with roast beef, and this version is just right for a special occasion. Adding flavor are typical steak house ingredients, like mushrooms, garlic and herbs. Place a baking sheet in the oven on the rack below the gratin to catch any liquids that may bubble over.
5018914~This delicious and easy-to-make salad would be nice with grilled lamb or steak.
5018915~Kararee Bhindi
5018916~Highly recommended!
5018917~Tart, fruity pomegranate molasses brightens up the mellow turkey.
5018918~Using the pan drippings to sauté the vegetables allows the bacon's smokiness to permeate the whole dish. It's a striking complement to the sweet potatoes and red peppers. And don't fret about making too much—you won't have leftovers for long. The flavors will meld further and make for a terrific breakfast the next day.
5018919~Lamb shoulder chops are everything a cook wants: They're inexpensive and quick-cooking, yet they deliver more robust flavor than pricier rib chops.
5018920~If desired, the smoothie can be strained to remove the berry seeds, but the seeds contain lots of beneficial dietary fiber.
5018921~The streusel topping adds nice crunch.
5018922~Highly recommended!
5018923~Gremolata is the classic osso buco garnish of minced lemon peel, garlic, and parsley. In this version, lemon peel and shallots perfume a simple breadcrumb topping.
5018924~This take on classic Caesar salad uses nonfat yogurt in place of oil and egg (or oil and mayonnaise) for a lean but creamy dressing that is enhanced by grated Parmesan.
5018925~Great served warm or at room temperature.
5018926~Irish bacon, sliced and packaged, is increasingly available at supermarkets. If you find it at the butcher counter, ask the butcher to slice it into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
5018927~Apple cider vinegar makes the crust extra flaky. Offer eggnog ice cream (or vanilla ice cream sprinkled with nutmeg) alongside.
5018928~In contrast to American renditions of this dish, which often feature a heavy tomato sauce, the Italian version focuses on the pasta itself. The clam and tomato accompaniment is light and simple. Red pepper flakes add a bit of heat, but you can reduce the amount if you prefer less spice.
5018929~Highly recommended!
5018930~A colorful salad of cooked green beans, roasted red pepper strips and marinated artichoke hearts looks and tastes terrific with this meatless version of a classic. Pass a plate of brownies for dessert.

5018937~When it comes to marinating these steaks, go long. Time adds intense flavor, the wine helps tenderize, and you can get it going before you hit the road.
5018938~Just when we thought there were no new ways to cook an egg, along came these adorable little vessels that yield soft-boiled meals in a cup.
5018939~This recipe adapts traditional Indian tandoori cooking for a barbecue. The chicken needs to marinate overnight, so start this one day ahead.
5018940~Zucchini gives a summery twist to the classic leek-and-potato soup; this new take on an old favorite is served at Quisiana.
5018941~This fall soup is like putting on the first sweater of the season: it just feels so good. Although the soup takes several steps—roasting the squash and pears (which can be done a day ahead of time), cooking them, and finally pureeing the soup—none involve much from you. It's an easily made soup that will keep well for days—a great possibility for a holiday meal.
5018942~An easy side dish with flavor from green onions, parsley, oregano and Parmesan.
5018943~Highly recommended!
5018944~"Anne Marie Gaspard of Gros Islet, St. Lucia, writes: ""I've always enjoyed cooking — for my family and for myself. My children are grown, so when they visit on Sundays, I spoil them with good home-cooked meals. During the week I like to make dishes that are different but still easy."""
5018945~We recommend using a good-quality California or Spanish sparkling wine for this punch. Both are widely available and less expensive than Champagne.
5018946~Highly recommended!
5018947~Also great with lamb, duck, or chicken.
5018948~Try it with: Roast turkey sandwiches with cucumber and cilantro, chicken salad with grapes, or as a dipping sauce for satay-style appetizers. (Indian curry paste can be found at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Indian markets.)
5018949~Great with: Grilled hoisin-glazed ribs, pork chops, or chicken satay.
5018950~"Tonya Morrison of Lewis Center, Ohio, writes: ""My husband and I had a wonderful time on our vacation to Kiawah Island, South Carolina.

5018955~Green beans have a certain suave, slender elegance that makes them a classic accompaniment to rosy-red roast beef. But too often, they get short shrift: a quick drizzle of butter, a squirt of lemon, and onto the table they go. We suggest you coddle them a little this year. Try tossing them in a hot skillet with shallots and pecans that get caramelized in buttery brown sugar, and you'll see just how special green beans can be.

5018959~These ultimate latkes have fluffy, pillowy-soft centers with crisp, golden brown edges. To cut your cooking time in half, use two large skillets to fry twice the batches at once.
5018960~This elegant dish is perfect for weeknight entertaining. There are many different kinds of herbed white wine vinegars; choose your favorite. Serve with: Green beans sautéed with mushrooms, and mashed potatoes with chives.
5018961~This lovely treat is usually filled with simple whipped cream and presented at teatime. Inspired by a dessert from Ballymaloe Cookery School, this one is dressed up with luscious coffee-whiskey cream and coffee-flavored meringues.
5018962~This turns a terrific gingerbread—created by Rick Rodgers, an accomplished baker and food writer—into a layer cake. Let the stout stand, opened, at room temperature overnight so that it’s flat when you add it to the batter.
5018963~A tangy feta and yogurt sauce is the perfect foil for these fresh-tasting latkes. They make a nice starter for a party of ten.
5018964~"This recipe is from chef Peter Doyle from Cicada in Sydney. ""This dish is a play on Maltaise sauce, but in a lighter, fresher version more conducive to our climate."""
5018965~Samali

5018971~Highly recommended!
5018972~"""A good newspaper review of the Cosmos Cafe in Houston convinced me to try out the restaurant and particularly the owners award-winning green chili,"" says Janice E. Bryant of Humble, Texas. ""It was everything chili should be—hearty and hot with a great kick from poblano chilies."""
5018973~This recipe epitomizes what a great ceviche should be—crunchy, sweet, savory, tart, and rich all in one bite. Corvina, a type of sea bass, is the most widely used fish in South America for ceviche, and is very forgiving for the novice. Its firm, lean flesh holds up better to acid and is easy to either thinly slice or dice.
5018974~Living in the Pacific Northwest, with our bounty of berries, tree-ripened fruits, hazelnuts, and wild mushrooms, makes going to the farmers' market feel like a season-long treasure hunt. I'm especially rewarded when I stop at the mushroom forager's stand and see a basket chock-full of chanterelle mushrooms. At the peak of the season, I buy fresh chanterelles and use them as often as I can, as in this golden-hued mushroom gravy accompaniment to the holiday bird.
5018975~Chickpeas transform saucy mussels into a meal that's as hearty as it is seductive.

5018979~This dessert honors two good friends of the tomato—basil and cheese. Garnishes of candied cherry tomatoes and fried basil make it extra-special.
5018980~"These rolls are based loosely on b'stilla — a phyllo-crusted ""pie"" of shredded chicken that's been simmered with Moroccan spices and then mixed with egg and nuts. The egg lends the filling an almost custard-like richness."
5018981~Boiling down the cider gives great apple flavor; parsley adds color and freshness.
5018982~This refined French appetizer is traditionally made by pounding confit of pork, goose, or (in this case) duck into a silky paste. Here a mortar and pestle is replaced by a food processor and elbow grease by a light touch — rillettes are best easily spread but not quite smooth.
5018983~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5018984~Grilled and then tossed with a simple mustard vinaigrette, these vegetables turn tender and juicy, providing an ideal foil for the hearty grilled steaks.
5018985~Thinly sliced roast turkey can be used instead of Black Forest ham.
5018986~Highly recommended!

5018990~Pink peppercorns add a lovely floral note to this pretty dessert.
5018991~Highly recommended!
5018992~Set out all of the components of this fun and delicious dish and allow guests to add their own toppings. Because the chili is meatless, the vegetarians in the crowd can also enjoy this meal by simply omitting the crispy cubed-pork topping.
5018993~Highly recommended!
5018994~This homey dessert gets its name from its lack of structure, which causes it to slump on the plate. Slumps are also known as grunts, a name that may describe the sound berries make as they cook. No matter which name you use, this old-fashioned treat is usually made of cooked fruit with a biscuit topping. Here, dried figs, apricots, tart cherries, and raisins make up the filling. The light, airy biscuits are similar to dumplings.
5018995~Here's a great way to blow eggs that is efficient, sanitary, and creates no mess.
5018996~Peas and onions are a classic holiday duo. Relying on frozen ones, along with a quick béchamel, is a smart move on a busy day of cooking.
5018997~This Mediterranean-style dish can be teamed with green beans and rice, noodles or sautéed potatoes for an easy and sophisticated supper.
5018998~My mom makes the most delicious salmon chowder. It always reminds me how tasty leeks are. The combination of tomatoes and cream creates a pretty pink base.
5018999~The plummy-berry notes of red wine are highlighted when mixed with chocolate and butter into a glaze that drips over the edges of this decadent dark chocolate cake.
5019000~Traditionally used to season pâtés and terrines, this French spice mixture also adds an earthy depth to the duck confit.
5019001~I, who struggled for years to achieve perfectly cooked, lively green beans love Aunt Enza's overstewed green beans, soft, almost creamy, tasting of bean, cooked far beyond crunch. Although Aunt Enza cooks the green beans in an onion and garlic-flavored tomato sauce she pointed out that leftover green beans can be subjected to the same treatment. Aunt Enza has a heavy Tuscan hand with extra virgin. I've cut down on the oil but my husband Massimo always adds a little extra at the table.
5019002~In 1917, a society grande dame asked Julius Keller, maître d’ of the Casino restaurant in New York, to surprise her with a new dish. Keller presented clams baked on the half shell, topped with minced bell pepper, herb butter and bacon. By the twenties, Clams Casino, as Keller called it, was ubiquitous on restaurant menus. Here is a lightened version with great lively flavors.
5019003~My mother-in-law remembers the kapparah tradition in Poland. Early in the morning of the day prior to Yom Kippur, a fowl was whirled about her head, while she thought about turning over a new leaf. Her father would whirl a rooster, her mother a hen, and her brothers and sisters a pullet or a cockerel. The ceremony was repeated for each child. She was always frightened by the fluttering feathers. After the whirling, her mother would race to the shohet and have the fowls ritually slaughtered to make food for the meal before the fast. All the fowls would be cooked, and any extras given to bachelor relatives or to the poor. Chicken soup would be made for the kreplakh and the boiled chicken eaten as a mild main dish.
5019004~Creamy lobster salad heaped onto a buttered, toasted hot dog bun is the quintessential summer sandwich in northeastern shore towns. This is an equally delicious — and more economical — variation.
5019005~Highly recommended!
5019006~Highly recommended!
5019007~The caramelized milk jam makes for a decadent little sandwich, but these cookies are amazingly good simply eaten on their own.
5019008~You don't need an endless supply of ingredients to create a flavor-packed stir-fry. Here, flank steak and fresh Napa cabbage come together without fuss, thanks to a Chinese sauce that requires little work.
5019009~An all-purpose barbecue-style marinade that is great with chicken, quail, and duck.
5019010~This recipe is an accompaniment for Coffee-Cardamom Flans with Orange Crème Fraîche.
5019011~Highly recommended!
5019012~Highly recommended!
5019013~"Cabbage is a green you can keep in the root cellar deep into the winter, and it is often sliced thin and sautéed in butter or bacon grease as a sturdy side for a cold-weather supper. This soup pairs it perfectly with tangy buttermilk and the fragrantly earthy black walnuts that fall in abundance in the autumn. Black walnuts are a bear to get to, their outer husks staining hands a deep purplish black, the inner shells so hard that it breaks the nut meats inside to crack them. But they are so beloved and flavorful that mountain families would spend long winter evenings peeling, cracking, and picking black walnuts by the fire.
If you don’t have or don’t like black walnuts, you can make the “pesto” with pecans. It will be great, but just different."
5019014~Highly recommended!
5019015~The fennel seeds add a nice dimension to these tender scones.

5019018~Although polenta is traditionally made with cornmeal, we substituted matzo meal—with great results. It's far more tender than regular polenta, and tastes especially wonderful with the sauce from the braised veal with gremolata .

5019020~This no-cook quickie dinner is less than 18 percent fat. Dig in!
5019021~Catfish stays tender and moist when baked in a crunchy crust of bread crumbs and cornmeal. A take on traditional New Orleans rémoulade adds a piquant punch.
5019022~This Indian-inspired salad can also be served warm as a side dish.
5019023~We serve a lot of carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. People love the moist cake with the creamy frosting—and, from our informal polling, our customers prefer their carrot cake without raisins or nuts and with lots of cream cheese frosting!
5019024~We’ll be spreading membrillo (quince paste) inside bread for grilled cheese from now on. This recipe is from Morcilla, one of Bon Appétit's Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.
5019025~If using skin-on hazelnuts, rub them inside a clean kitchen towel after they've been toasted—the skins will slip right off. Serve the fish with a lightly dressed butter lettuce and herb salad.

5019031~Fish dish: Tori Amos's favorite recipe
5019032~Reminiscent of fragrant Mexican chocolate (which is spiced with cinnamon), and as fudgy as a chocolate truffle, this dessert will serve many more than six, but leftovers will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator.
5019033~This is a kind of picadillo, a typical Spanish stew. It's also a great way to use up the (usually) less popular dark meat from the turkey. Readily available pumpkin pie spice introduces a touch of sweetness — and makes a nice addition to the spice shelf. Accompany this dish with steamed rice, a basket of warm tortillas, and an arugula and red onion salad. For a Latin-style dessert, drizzle warm caramel sauce over caramel ice cream and top with some sliced bananas.
5019034~Serve this saucy dish with steamed rice or crusty French bread.
5019035~These crunchy, salty, pretzel-coated chicken cutlets are lightened up by creamy cauliflower purée (a great substitute for mashed potatoes) and a crisp arugula salad. It all adds up to the perfect weeknight meal.

5019039~Sure, go ahead and cook your favorite sausages, but be sure to use every iota of their flavor: Reheat the skillet and work some pork-based magic on a seasonal array of onion, fennel, tomatoes, and corn.
5019040~There's no question: If meatloaf, then potatoes. These have all the comfort of mashed, but with a nice texture from the potato slices and from being baked in cream. And they can go in the oven along with the meatloaf, so dinner will be ready all at once.
5019041~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less but requires additional unattended time.
5019042~Highly recommended!
5019043~This subtly spicy mayo is great on fish and sandwiches—and on fries, too.

5019050~"Most freshwater and ocean fish can be marinated for only 30 minutes at most—or they turn opaque and are essentially ""cooked"" before you even go out to the grill. The exception, though, is strong-flavored, oily fish like amberjack, bluefish, salmon, mackerel, marlin, mullet, or even our old standby, farm-raised catfish, which can stand up to longer marinating. In fact, marinating these oily fish for a longer time makes them taste even better."

5019061~Despite some tall tales, Hostess Twinkies do not last forever. The box of Twinkies that my friends gave me as a gag gift were, in fact, hard as a rock in less than a year. These cream-filled chiffon cake snacks, made with real, unprocessed dairy and eggs and whole-grain flours, won't last nearly as long as preservative-laden Twinkies, but you will almost certainly gobble them up in no time at all.
5019062~We found that 1 green chile was enough, but add more if you like things fiery.
5019063~Live in a magical place where cloudberries abound? Use them instead of the cherries, as they do in Norway.
5019064~Highly recommended!
5019065~I like to make this intensely flavored sugar and use it in all my baking. The flavor of vanilla always improves a cake, cookies or a tart, and can even add an alluring flavor to bread. This sugar is also delicious stirred into plain yogurt, sprinkled atop buttered toast and for dipping strawberries.

5019086~Tenderize the boneless chicken breast halves by flattening them as you would for a chicken piccata, then marinating in lemon juice. What to drink: A crisp Sauvignon Blanc is ideal with both the breaded chicken and the asparagus risotto.

That's when bean varieties like the green Blue Lake or the yellow wax beans can be stir-grilled with a bit of olive oil for a very simple yet satisfying dish to use the surplus of beans. When you're in the mood for a more robust sauce, try this lemony pesto tossed with the grilled beans right before serving.

5019092~Wonderfully crunchy, toasted panko transforms an ordinary vegetable into a truly special side dish.

5019101~"If there's one dish guaranteed to be on every Indian restaurant menu, it's chicken tikka masala, which is composed of grilled chunks of chicken enveloped in a creamy spiced tomato sauce. What's behind this simple dish's tremendous popularity? ""Tomato sauce has universal appeal. When the dish is eaten with naan bread, it's like an Indian version of pizza!"" exclaims cookbook author and cooking teacher Julie Sahni, one of the most respected authorities on Indian cooking."
5019102~Making Stollen is not for the faint of heart. Avoiding it altogether because excellent store-bought Stollen abounds is further abetted by the invention of Stollenkonfekt, bite-size chunks of spiced, tender Quark dough studded with almonds and raisins and thickly cloaked in vanilla-scented confectioners’ sugar. They may be a relatively recent development in the world of Christstollen, which dates back to the Middle Ages, but they more than make up for their youth. In other words, want the rich, buttery, spicy flavor of Stollen without the work of a yeasted dough and the weeks of impatiently waiting for the loaves to be ready? If so, Stollenkonfekt is the thing for you.
5019103~This versatile salsa also pairs well with scallops or roast fish.
5019104~These super-light and airy biscuits, with their peppery bite, are as good alongside a hearty dinner as they are for a savory morning treat with jam.
5019105~Humitas
5019106~Thinly shaving the asparagus gives the familiar vegetable a new look—and a delicate taste. Because the asparagus is shaved so thinly, there is no need to cook it.
5019107~Highly recommended!
5019108~The addition of airy brioche gives this aromatic spiced stuffing a less dense texture than most holiday casseroles.
5019109~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019110~Sandwiching the puff pastry between two baking sheets ensures that the pastry rises perfectly even.
5019111~Couscous with fresh herbs, and steamed green beans sprinkled with toasted pine nuts would be lovely accompaniments. Dessert? Try warm apple turnovers from the bakery; top with ice cream.
5019112~Traditional papillote takes time and requires origami-like folding. Here, we use foil to make a no-mess pouch; the fish becomes infused with the flavors of tomato, capers, garlic, and lemon.
5019113~This cut of meat yields a juicy roast with no fuss. And the spicy parsley sauce is tasty enough to keep some on hand for chicken, fish, or pasta.
5019114~Highly recommended!

5019119~Cinnamon, cloves, ginger and cayenne pepper enhance this North African-style dish. Serve the stew over the Saffron-Cardamom Rice or plain basmati rice.
5019120~Most of the ingredients used in this recipe are staples, so all you need to buy are the breadcrumbs, chicken, and parsley. Look for panko in the Asian foods section of supermarkets and at Asian markets.
5019121~Most of these ingredients can be found in the Asian section of any supermarket. Frequent basting makes the wings shine!

5019127~"I love many versions of baked stuffed tomatoes, but the simple recipe of Torquato Innocenti, who sells tomatoes in Florence's Piazza Santo Spirito market, is my favorite. Nothing more than garlic, basil or parsley, and ""good oil"" fills the tomatoes."
5019128~Using goat cheese and nonfat ricotta skims fat, not flavor.
5019129~Uncork a Zinfandel or a dry Riesling.
5019130~After trying every turkey-roasting method under the sun, I've finally settled on this as absolutely the best. The secret? Slow down the cooking of the breast area, which tends to get overcooked and dried out before the dark meat is done, with a cover of aluminum foil.

A slice each or orange and lemon, a pineapple spear and a maraschino cherry are sometimes used for garnish, and a splash of rum or brandy may be added to the drink.

5019148~The mild spice paste is also great used as a base for chicken and shrimp curries.
5019149~Highly recommended!
5019150~This recipe makes quite a bit of stock, but that's a blessing since it must cook for 24 hours. Freeze it in 1-quart containers (or smaller) so it's handy for later use. If you are pressed for time, by all means begin with a prepared version of demiglace (available in most grocery stores or online, such as Demi-Glace Gold brand), and dilute it with 2 to 3 parts water—this is a fine and practical option to making your own veal stock.
5019151~These sweet, tangy wings should appeal to even the pickiest kid. Eight pounds may sound like a lot, but no matter how many of these we made in our test kitchens, they always disappeared quickly. You may not have the oven space to cook the wings and the macaroni simultaneously. We found it best to do the wings first, then keep them warm under foil while baking the macaroni. Finally, because the wings tend to leave a mess to clean up, we like to make them in disposable foil roasting pans.
5019152~A Gin Rickey is a mix of gin, lime juice, and club soda. We've added crushed raspberries and rose water, which makes the berry flavor sing. Any gin will work, but the cucumber and rose notes of Hendrick's are particularly good here. Garnish with lime slices and whole berries.
5019153~Thai red chilies are used at Keo's, but a sliced jalapeño chili will work just as well.
5019154~Makes 12 to 16 servings.
5019155~This recipe is an accompaniment for Summer Vegetable Curry.
5019156~Though inspired by golden cherries from the farmers' market, this pretty salad can be made with any sort of fresh or frozen cherry. Marcona almonds hail from Spain; their toasty, slightly sweet and salty flavor is a great match for the fruit. Toasted whole almonds and a few extra pinches of sea salt can be substituted.
5019157~The heat chars the edges of the romaine leaves and softens the inner layers.
5019158~This southwestern version of fried chicken needs only two sides: purchased Mexican-style rice pilaf and a sauté of bell peppers and carrots. Flan with sliced kiwi would be a nice finish. Look for ancho chili powder in the spice section of your supermarket.
5019159~Smoky, sweet, crusty, and beefy, with charred bones to gnaw on: If this isn't a perfect steak, we don't know what is.

5019167~"Chef Kris Wessel of Florida Cookery in Miami Beach, Florida, shared this recipe as part of a Palm Tree Christmas menu he created exclusively for Epicurious. At Wessel family Christmases at Grandmother Esther's house in Miami Beach, the main courses were Florida-centric, but the desserts were not. This particular rum cake was often served by one of Wessel's aunts. ""I think all the Irish side of our family loved it because it was loaded with rum,"" he says, joking that they'd often add more to the glaze than the recipe called for. The alcohol will burn off, but you can also omit the rum glaze and just serve with ice cream."
5019168~Beat the egg yolks and sugar together until thick. Slowly stir in the brandy, rum, peach brandy, milk and cream. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled and pour into a punch bowl. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold gently into the eggnog. Grate a little nutmeg on top and serve in 4-ounce punch glasses.

Mix 12 ounces diced browned bacon, 2 tablespoons drippings, 1 minced garlic clove, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and 1/4 cup dry white wine in large skillet. Bring to simmer; keep warm. Cook pasta; proceed with recipe.
5019174~These creamy custards feature the flavors of chai, a spiced tea that's enhanced with cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and ginger.
5019175~You can use the same weight in regular apples for this gingerbread cake recipe, but don’t the little lady apples just look so awesome?!
5019176~The mustard dressing is used both to marinate the lamb and to coat the salad. And don't let the anchovies in the dressing scare you off. They add depth of flavor, but not a fishy taste. Complete this dish with a chilled Beaujolais.
5019177~Fill your plate with corn on the cob, sweet-potato chips, and dill pickles. For dessert, have watermelon wedges and sugar cookies.
5019178~The steak served at Chamberlain's Prime Chop House in Dallas, Texas, is flavored with a soy sauce and honey marinade. Pour a Merlot with dinner, and serve a spice cake with peach ice cream for dessert.
5019179~For an alternative marinade, combine 3 tablespoons each red-wine vinegar and olive oil with salt and pepper.
5019180~A typical chili of the depression years consisted of cheap meat stretched by even cheaper beans. Chili remained modestly popular even when the hard times waned, until Lyndon Johnson boosted its national profile during the 1960s. Now chili is back and bigger than ever. Even with the modern addition of smoked jalapeños (chipotles), the inclusion of black beans and beer, and a stylish drizzle of lime crema, this recipe is a classic-hot, hearty and filling.
5019181~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Passionate Vegetarian by Crescent Dragonwagon.

Sounds awesome, right? Of course it's awesome—how the hell can you screw something like that up? Of course, we eventually tired of awesome and needed to go past that to ""mind blowing.""

5019204~Brussels sprouts were not part of the Palestinian kitchen when I was growing up. I discovered them here in the States and very eagerly tried to push them on my children. To that end, I did what any good mother would do—I pumped up their flavor by adding a little tahini sauce and sweet pomegranate molasses. It worked! In fact these Brussels sprouts were so delicious that they made it onto the original Tanoreen menu and I've never taken them off.

5019216~Highly recommended!
5019217~Why use frozen berries in the summer, when local fruit is at its peak? Because we love fresh local berries so much when whole or, in the case of strawberries, when sliced as well, puréeing them seems almost a sacrilege. If, however, you've got a surplus of fresh berries, go ahead and purée them.
5019218~Highly recommended!

5019221~Pillsbury test kitchen home economists have heard it all. When they told me some people were adding melted ice cream to a cake mix, I couldn't believe it. Well, that's precisely what I did with this fun recipe. Choose your flavor and let the ice cream melt. The only trick is that you must have 2 cups of melted ice cream. For super-premium ice creams with little overrun, that's 1 pint frozen. But for less expensive brands with a lot of air piped in, you'll need to begin with more than a pint.

5019266~"This is our salsa closest to the classic home-style Mexican salsa de molcajete that's made from roasted garlic and chiles pounded in a lava-rock mortar (molcajete) with roasted tomatoes. Even though we've updated the equipment for the modern American kitchen, that perfect blend of sweetness (roasted garlic and tomatoes) and raciness (roasted jalapeños) is what you'll spoon out. The final addition of fresh cilantro and a drizzle of vinegar focuses the whole experience: This is just what most Americans wish they were getting when they open a jar with that ubiquitous ""salsa"" label. Made with plum tomatoes, your salsa will have a more homogenous texture — just right for using the salsa as an ingredient in other dishes. Because round tomatoes give a looser texture, choose them when you want a condiment to set on the table."

5019291~Why you'll make it: Because it's an all-purpose refresher — drink it straight, top with sparkling water, or spike with vodka, gin, or tequila.
5019292~You'll see fibers running through the cooked steak; make sure to cut across them for tender slices.
5019293~This harkens to those beloved jam-filled cookies that have been favorites in cookie jars for generations. This savory twist embellishes the dough with Parmesan cheese, the jam in question made with tomato and tart cherries. The jam recipe makes more than is needed for this batch of cookies, but it's not practical to make in smaller quantities. Extra will keep well in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Spread it on turkey or ham sandwiches, slather it on chicken breasts before baking, or serve as an accompaniment to cheese. You can use dried cranberries in place of the dried tart cherries, if you like.

5019296~Bake and freeze the Triple-Chocolate Cookies a day before filling them with ice cream. For convenience, you can make the homemade ice cream up to three days in advance. Purchased strawberry ice cream (softened slightly at room temperature until spreadable) also works in these sandwiches.
5019297~Highly recommended!

5019302~For some time I had been thinking: How can I pare down a classic meat sauce for those occasions when I have neither the time to make nor the voracity to consume a full-scale ragù? The sauce below is the answer I came up with. I replaced beef with veal; eliminated the milk, the wine, the carrot, and the celery; and reduced the cooking time from several hours to half of one. It is as easy to take as it is to do. Is it a favorite dish? Sure — it is my favorite simple meat sauce.
5019303~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019304~Highly recommended!
5019305~Fresh rosemary enhances this terrific side dish from Il Radicchio in Washington, D.C.
5019306~An incredible frozen treat that doesn't require an ice cream maker. Serve with crisp butter cookies.
5019307~"Translated from medieval Scottish, farl means, ""the fourth part."" In this version, quartered rounds of dark bread are sweetened with treacle, which is similar to molasses, and lightly spiced with ginger. The mixture may occasionally include a handful of raisins or other dried fruit, but the bread is always served sliced and buttered, with a cup of tea."
5019308~Highly recommended!
5019309~The heat in fresh poblano chiles varies considerably; you may want to use more than one in this dish if they are not too hot. The sautéed vegetables can sit at room temperature for several hours before serving.
5019310~Highly recommended!
5019311~The fresh herbs and scallion might seem strange, but they work. And the hot sauce? Makes anything better.
5019312~This softly set ice cream isn't churned, so you don't need an ice cream maker.
5019313~Set out black beans, rice, lettuce, salsa and hot flour tortillas to go with the chicken.
5019314~Highly recommended!
5019315~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019316~Stifado, a hearty Greek stew, can be made with almost any kind of meat, though beef is most common. Here we use lamb. It always involves either red wine or red-wine vinegar or both, herbs, and copious quantities of small whole onions.

5019329~"The aged goat cheese called for in this recipe is firmer than fresh and has a dry rind. Two kinds work best in this dish, Bucheron and Pouligny-St.-Pierre, both of which have just the right amount of tang — but ask at the cheese counter for comparable substitutes if you have trouble finding them. Cafe Pasqual's, in Santa Fe, serves its version of this dish — ""pigs 'n' figs"" — with blue cheese."
5019330~This recipe was created by chef Traci Des Jardins of San Francisco's Jardinière. It's part of a special menu she created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program.
5019331~This tender buttermilk cake with rich orange cream-cheese frosting is sure to become your go-to for any festive occasion. The recipe can easily be adjusted to suit any party need: Make this single layer cake for birthdays, bake it as a sheet cake for backyard barbecues, or as a double-layer cake for even bigger celebrations.
5019332~The icebox has gone the way of the horse and buggy, but it didn't disappear before lending its name to the original concept of the slice-and-bake cookie. A roll of this flavorful dough—chock-full of pistachios, cranberries, and oats—in the freezer or fridge is like money in the bank. Impromptu party? Friends drop by unexpectedly? No problem! Just cut off the slices you need, bake them up, and the aroma alone will drive people crazy before they even get a chance to take a bite.
5019333~Boiling the potatoes and chilling them overnight makes them easy to cut and sauté. Leftover potatoes and brisket would make a great breakfast hash.
5019334~Highly recommended!
5019335~Lemon peel and lemon juice, rosemary, and an olive oil dressing give this a nice lightness. If you prefer a creamy potato salad, use 2/3 cup mayonnaise in place of the olive oil.
5019336~Highly recommended!
5019337~Root vegetables are a staple of Irish cooking. They often show up in soups, such as this one from The Courtyard in Schull, Ireland.
5019338~It's unusual to butter and flour the pan when making a chiffon cake, but we liked the delicate crust that resulted. Because we did it this way, the cake must be cooled, inverted, on a rack, not on a bottle (the usual procedure for chiffons), or it will fall right out of the pan!
5019339~Highly recommended!
5019340~To make this fresh American rendition of panzanella (the Italian bread-and-tomato salad), bake the cornbread one day ahead so that it will be firm enough to toast on the grill.
5019341~The delicate 1/16-inch-wide pasta ribbons known as taglierini or tagliolini are the perfect foil for scallops and this elegant-and easy-sauce.
5019342~This fennel-and-scallion-enriched version of tyropita (Greek cheese pie) uses feta and cottage cheese to create a filling that's mildly tangy yet mellow.
5019343~The addition of sour cream makes this creamed spinach extra-tangy and echoes the traditional sour cream served with classic potato pancakes.
5019344~Fresh sardines are widely available in California, but can be more difficult to find in the rest of the country. If fresh sardines are not available in your area, you can make a terrific spread with canned sardines.
5019345~Highly recommended!
5019346~We prefer Gorgonzola, Italy's star blue cheese, for this recipe, but if Iowa's Maytag blue — or another import — is easier to find in your area, then use it instead.
5019347~Highly recommended!
5019348~Highly recommended!
5019349~Unlock the cure for the common roast turkey with New York City chef Heather Carlucci-Rodriguez's ingenious techniques: First, toast and grind whole spices to coax out their essential oils. Next, marinate the turkey with the spices and yogurt in an oven roasting bag overnight. Then roast the turkey in the bag to lock in flavors and keep the meat ultra juicy. You'll have plenty of richly spiced gravy to pass around the table.
5019350~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019351~The ingredients are simple, but they add up to a main course that's incredibly hearty and satisfying. Cute little lady apples, cooked until soft and almost bursting, bring a luscious sweetness to the chicken and bacon.
5019352~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019353~If you like stuffing with smoked oysters, you'll like it even more with tart lemons on top.
5019354~"Garam means ""hot"" and masala means ""spiced,"" though the mixture is not chili-hot. Instead the classic garam masala spices called for in the recipe-cardamom, cloves, black pepper, cumin, and cinnamon-are warmly aromatic."
5019355~Highly recommended!
5019356~Porcini mushrooms reinvent a traditional Eastern European pilaf and add oomph. Try it as a meatless main course.
5019357~The richness of almonds, hazelnuts, cashews, and pistachios embodies the generosity of the season. A kiss of honey and brown sugar adds a sweet touch.
5019358~Ginger and crushed red pepper help round out the Thai theme of this quick dish.
5019359~The Indian-spiced yogurt raita does double-duty, flavoring the chicken and serving as a dipping sauce.
5019360~Make the tartar sauce at least one day ahead.
5019361~Highly recommended!
5019362~Use chilled fruit (and a frozen banana) for an even more refreshing drink.
5019363~This recipe is used to prepare Cod Cannelloni with Swiss Chard and Roasted Peppers .
5019364~Perfect before grilled fish or roast chicken.
5019365~Eggplant, zucchini, bell pepper and arugula share the stage with slices of tuna steak in the Mediterranean-inspired sandwich. Spoon the lentil salad alongside and offer chilled beer. Fresh pears and crisp biscotti round things out nicely.

5019373~The secret to these ribs is the stunning glaze—these have great depth of flavor with a beautiful hit of sweetness and spice. Marinate them overnight for best results!
5019374~Contrary to popular opinion, Thanksgiving turkey, when not butter-basted, can be a healthful centerpiece to the meal. It's a superb source of lean protein, B vitamins, magnesium, and potassium. To add flavor without adding fat, this recipe uses a garlic-herb rub and a small amount of grapeseed oil, which raises good cholesterol. Another calorie-saving trick: In the gravy, roasted garlic replaces most of the fat from the drippings.
5019375~Two mustards mellowed with honey and yogurt make a terrific sauce for chicken — or even fish or pork. This is an ideal warm-weather dish because the sauce does't require cooking.
5019376~Pre-marinated pork tenderloins can be found in the supermarket meat section. To round out the meal, add a romaine salad dressed with Dijon vinaigrette and a basket of warm cranberry-corn muffins; finish with wedges of apple pie and sharp cheddar cheese.

5019384~Serve this main-course salad with some crusty bread, and offer fresh fruit for dessert. To prepare the dish, use leftovers from the Roast Pork Loin with Garlic and Rosemary , or broil two 4-ounce boneless pork loin chops until cooked through and then dice. Note that nutritional numbers are for either cut of pork.
5019385~These crab-stuffed mushrooms are a longtime favorite at Phillips. Tip: Use a melon baller to scoop out the mushroom stems.
5019386~Highly recommended!
5019387~Order the lamb from your butcher, and buy the pomegranate juice at a Middle Eastern market or at a natural foods store. Begin preparing this richly flavored main course one day ahead.
5019388~Sturdy forest-green collards provide the wrapping for buttery, juicy mushrooms. Elegance comes easily when it comes to these bundles, since they can be assembled a day ahead.
5019389~Highly recommended!
5019390~At Lantana's, the salmon is served with spiced banana fritters.
5019391~What started as an arepa recipe evolved into a play on traditional American corn-bread stuffing. Chorizo takes the place of fresh sausage, and garlic adds punch to a buttery base. Imagine all of the classic textures with Latino flavorsits that good.
5019392~Beer-Can Chicken, step aside. Cabbage becomes the star of any backyard barbecue with this awesome beer-steaming–plus–grilling technique. Slathering the cabbage with barbecue sauce during cooking gives it a smoky, sweet flavor. Top with rich cheddar cheese, fresh slaw, and spicy pickled jalapeños and you'll never miss the meat in this hearty vegetarian sandwich.

5019396~Diced apple, dried apricots and golden raisins accent this 30-minute entrée.
5019397~My mom's meat loaf is inarguably better than yours, but this is not my mom's meat loaf recipe. This one is an amalgam, intended to evoke all the important meat loaves in my life—and there have been many: The meat loaf I'd get at the family table as a child; the meat loaf I'd find (if I was lucky) in the steam table in the school cafeteria, usually festering in a pool of graying commercial gravy (God, I loved that stuff—especially when stoned); the meat loaf in the familiar foil tray of a Swanson TV dinner (which freed me from the oppression of a loving dinner table!); and the meat loaf my bosses insisted I keep on the menu at my first chef job—the restaurant failed, but the meat loaf was quite good. This, then is the sum of all those experiences.
5019398~This sausage uses chicken and schmaltz, along with plentiful sage, garlic, ginger and pepper. And salt of course—sausage needs salt. My optimal salt level is 1.75 percent, so I multiply the weight of the meat (in ounces or grams) by 0.0175 to get that amount of the salt needed (also in ounces or grams). If you like less salt take it back to 1.5%.
5019399~Fresh and colorful, this vegetarian entrée is an ideal bring-along for a potluck supper. Quinoa, a delicate grain with a texture similar to that of couscous, cooks up in just 15 minutes. A complete protein, it's also nutritious. Look for it at supermarkets and natural foods stores. Smoked paprika can be found in the spice section of the supermarket.
5019400~Healthy bonus: 1 serving of fruit per slice, protein and riboflavin from eggs, calcium from yogurt, fiber, and nearly 1/3 of the RDA for vitamin C from berries
5019401~Highly recommended!
5019402~When tomatoes are at their peak, I could eat them three times a day and straight from the vine. But every once in a while, it's nice to give them a little special attention. When that time comes, this is the recipe I turn to. It's a tartlet that looks like it takes all day to make, but is really a quickie. It's warmed in the oven for such a short time that the tomatoes never lose their fresh-picked taste and texture. I serve these as a first course at dinner or with a salad as the main event at lunch.
5019403~Highly recommended!
5019404~This salad of melon, sweet pepper, salty cheese and earthy basil recalls the watermelon salad that we all love so much, but its elegant components make it more refined. Salt is key to marrying the flavors, so be generous, tasting as you go. Be liberal, too, with a very good extra-virgin olive oil—it is very much a part of this salad.
5019405~Highly recommended!
5019406~Splurge on lamb rib chops or save on loin chops; either way you will enjoy this Moroccan-inspired meal. The familiar flavors of an everything bagel make a surprise appearance here to spice a zesty yogurt dip. Harissa paste (available in specialty food stores and many grocery stores) adds a fiery punch to chickpeas simmered with carrots and tomatoes. It can vary greatly in spiciness and saltiness from brand to brand, so add a little at first and taste as you go.
5019407~"Pair this surf-and-turf dish with white rice to soak up the delicious rock-shrimp sauce — a quick and easy variation on Marcella Hazan's pink shrimp sauce (from ""Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking""), which she serves over pasta."
5019408~Renee brings the flavors of the Middle East to her special Friday-night chicken. Roast chunks of butternut squash and potatoes alongside to cook the whole meal at once. Look for roasting chickens next to the fryers.
5019409~Highly recommended!
5019410~Make these a day ahead to give the caramel time to soften and the custards time to set.
5019411~Luganega, a coiled slender Italian pork sausage sold at Italian markets and some supermarkets, often comes with flavorings such as spices and cheese. If you can't find it, substitute any fresh Italian sausage.
5019412~Highly recommended!
5019413~Sprinkle caraway seeds into tomato soup to begin the meal. Serve assorted mustards and pumpernickel bread with the choucroute, an Alsatian dish of sauerkraut and sausage. Then enjoy another flavor from Alsace: kirsch (clear cherry brandy), drizzled over cherry ice cream.
5019414~In Israel the word shakshuka is synonymous with breakfast. It's best with a slice or two of challah bread to sop up the juices. This is a version of my dad's recipe, except that he used to mix the eggs together, because my older sister refused to eat the egg whites. Here is the recipe I prefer.
5019415~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019416~Like the best dressings, this is good on so much more than greens: Drizzle it on roasted sweet potatoes, brush it onto broiled eggplant, or toss it with cold soba or udon noodles. Use it to marinate mushrooms before grilling them to make Juicy Bella . Look for miso paste in the refrigerated section of natural food stores and Asian markets. If you can find South River brand, made in Massachusetts, snap it up; it's the best I've tasted outside Japan.
5019417~Highly recommended!
5019418~Serve with scoops of vanilla ice cream.

5019421~In this recipe from Rick Tramonto, chef at Tru in Chicago, chewy pearl barley meets silky European butter in an outstanding alternative to arborio rice risotto. For best results, use Parmigiano-Reggiano.
5019422~If you can't find fresh porcini mushrooms, buy whole frozen ones, defrost them in the fridge, and drain them on paper towels. Then roast them, uncovered, until tender and golden brown (and for about half the time as the fresh ones). As a last resort, other exotic fresh mushrooms mixed with reconstituted dried porcini would provide the body and flavor the dish needs. (Avoid dried porcini that are broken up.) Pair this dish with a few risotto cakes to make a main course.
5019423~Highly recommended!
5019424~This fantastic dessert is perfect for the cool months of late fall and winter. Cubes of tender pumpkin bread are baked in a rich custard laced with bourbon and maple syrup. Crisp apple cider is the base of a buttery caramel sauce spiced with fresh ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and star anise. Forget about serving the same-old pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving and put this out instead for a new twist on two old classics. The recipe includes directions for making your own pumpkin bread to use in the pudding, but you can of course also use a loaf of pumpkin bread from your favorite bakery. Brioche or cinnamon-raisin bread would also work perfectly.
5019425~Paal Payasam
5019426~When we added Earl Grey ice cream to our trucks' offerings in 2009, New Yorkers went mad for it. Not surprisingly—black tea, combined with bergamot oil, cuts through the summer heat about as well as anything. We use a high-quality loose tea from our favorite tea brand, Rishi, which uses pure Italian bergamot citrus oil (and not bergamot flavoring), to make the most intensely fragrant Earl Grey tea ice cream.

5019428~This pie is best made with freshly cooked kuri squash purée.
5019429~Highly recommended!
5019430~We call for California avocados in our recipes because our food editors prefer their rich flavor and creamy texture to that of West Indian avocados, which tend to taste a bit bland and watery.
5019431~This recipe was created by chefs Slade Rushing and Allison Vines-Rushing of the Longbranch in Abita Springs, Louisiana. It's part of a special menu they created for Epicurious's Wine.Dine.Donate program.
5019432~Here's a colorful and creative pie: Apricots, which flourish in California, Hawaiian pineapple and Oregon cranberries come together in a filling that offers a terrific balance of the exotic and the traditional. It's good with vanilla ice cream.

5019445~This moist, simple cake has a tender golden crumb and a subtle citrus flavor. I love a thin slice—okay, a thick slice—in the middle of the afternoon with coffee, but it's also well matched with summer berries and stone fruits. My husband enjoys it for breakfast. Accompany the cake and fruit with a dollop of the Yogurt Cream, if you like. In winter, pair the cake with a citrus compote or poached quince.
5019446~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019447~On a warm, sunny day, pasta calls for fresh seafood, a big handful of herbs, and punchy lemon. All that's missing is the beach house
5019448~A simple dessert sauce that is absolutely delicious spooned over scoops of vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt.
5019449~This soup is also wonderful hot.

5019453~Gay Koenemann of Bonn, Germany, had dinner at 300 East Boulevard on a recent trip to Charlotte, North Carolina. There he was treated to the most exquisite salad he'd ever had. Although the restaurant calls it Fall Salad on the menu, it's enjoyable year-round.
5019454~Highly recommended!

5019463~The grits mixture will almost fill the entire baking dish and will puff up when baking, but don't worry — it won't overflow. Also, switching sides, these grits can take the place of mashed potatoes anytime.
5019464~Reinforce the southwestern theme with accompaniments like corn bread and a spinach salad with grapefruit segments and toasted pine nuts. For dessert, stir some cinnamon into sweetened whipped cream to dress up slices of chocolate pound cake.
5019465~This holiday-worthy recipe was inspired by bread pudding and ended up somewhere between a strata, a gratin, and a traditional Thanksgiving stuffing.
5019466~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019467~The term fines herbes refers to a blend of aromatic herbs that usually includes parsley, chervil, chives, and tarragon. The combination is used in sauces, vegetables, and meat dishes, but it also adds subtle freshness to green salads.
5019468~No, it's not a mistake. This cake really doesn't contain any eggs. The oil in the batter makes the cake moist; the rest of the ingredients provide enough structure to give the cake a great crumb.

5019484~Mushrooms and beef have long been an inspired combination, and here they're joined in a particularly sophisticated way. Dried porcini mushrooms grind to a powder in no time in a blender and add a subtle woodsiness to the beef, while the truffle butter enriches the sauce with its heady aroma. Black-truffle butter is the best deal going. It gives you tremendous flavor at an affordable price, a fraction of the cost of a fresh black truffle.
5019485~This tiny handmade pasta is a labor of love, but you'll be glad you devoted an afternoon to fresh pasta-making once you've tasted it. The tender orecchiette is irresistible once tossed in the rich, buttery sauce studded with savory mortadella and bright peas.
5019486~French toast is always better if your bread is a little dry — a day or two old, or leave the slices out overnight. Serve these crusty slices with bacon and warmed maple syrup, jam, or marmalade, or sprinkle them with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.
5019487~Highly recommended!
5019488~Tender and flavorful, sirloin needs little adornment. The olive sauce imparts just the right hint of spice and saltiness—and it's ready in about ten minutes.
5019489~This recipe originally accompanied Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate-Raspberry Frosting.
5019490~Sweet cherry tomatoes make an easy appetizer. What to drink: Top off glasses of cold lemonade with a splash of bourbon, and garnish with fresh mint sprigs. For wine drinkers, offer a California Pinot Noir.
5019491~Look for pomegranate juice in the juice aisle or fresh juice section of the supermarket.
5019492~It's the spicy, garlicky tomatillo salsa that really sells these addictive tostadas. Frying store-bought corn tortillas heightens the vibrancy of their corn flavor and creates a crisp foundation for the refried black beans, shredded romaine, lush avocado, and creamy queso fresco.
5019493~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Joan Nathan's book The Foods of Israel Today. Nathan also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious, which we've added at the bottom of the page.

Parvine used extra lemon juice and more fresh herbs than we were used to. The result was incredible—a delicious taste of lemon with every bite of grain and a burst of freshness from the blend of fresh herbs with every mouthful.
5019502~The lively dressing lends a little zip to this fresh-tasting, colorful salad.
5019503~Dried fruit, nuts, and oil-cured olives make this fruitcake something special.
5019504~Use this versatile sauce as a dip for crudités, a dressing for cold fish or chicken, and as a substitute for mayonnaise. Tofu makes it virtually fat-free.
5019505~Highly recommended!
5019506~This recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019507~One citrusy, chile-laced, and very hard-working marinade serves two functions, flavoring the pork chops before and after they hit the grill.
5019508~Cream cheese was added to the ricotta for this smooth, luscious dessert. But if you can find fresh ricotta, which is less grainy than some of the commercial types, use it and omit the cream cheese.
5019509~A classic combination in an adorable little package. The cupcakes, which are reminiscent of banana bread, would be a great breakfast treat (with or without the frosting).
5019510~Versions of picadillo—a savory dish of beef, onion, and tomato punctuated by olives and raisins—are served in many Latin American countries. Crowned with a tender biscuit topping made with arepa flour, it becomes a homey one-dish dinner.
5019511~The key to this sauté: Cook the tomatoes with the bits of chicken left over after you've seared it in the pan. When the tomatoes burst, swirl in the remaining marjoram butter to finish the pan sauce.
5019512~No crowd to feed? No problem. Sunday Sauce freezes well; just make sure any braciole, meatballs, or sausages are submerged in sauce.
5019513~"This simple pizza dough comes together quickly and is perfect for a thin crust pizza like ""Trenton Tomato Pie"" Pizza. The overnight rest is key for texture and flavor development."
5019514~Avoid rookie mistakes when it comes to barbecuing. If you apply the sauce too early, it will scorch. And most bottled sauces are too sweet, which is where this vinegary version comes in.
5019515~In this rich, sweet salad, we've included not just onions but their relatives in the Allium family — shallots, leeks, garlic, and chives. For meltingly tender results, be sure to peel off the papery outer layer, the leathery second layer, and any paper-thin membranes from the onions, shallots, and leeks.
5019516~This dish only looks indulgent: A serving has a mere 7 grams of saturated fat, and the pasta and peas help deliver 40 percent of your daily intake of folate, a nutrient that aids the body in forming red blood cells.
5019517~Sliced thin and broiled, eggplant retains a slight chewiness but still melts in the mouth; a caper and mint vinaigrette brightens everything.

5019541~Cooking the wings slowly over medium-low coals and turning them often makes for crisp results; the skin will brown while the meat cooks through. Be sure to begin 1 day ahead; the chicken needs to marinate overnight for the flavors to infuse.
5019542~"James is very proud to have a pastry department at Blue Bottle Coffee. He loves that making our own food gives us control over the customer's entire experience. He has made a big deal about not having what he calls a PBM (perfunctory bran muffin) on his shelves. Well, it turns out that many people really like to have a muffin for breakfast, and customers who came in expecting to find one in the pastry case were disappointed that we didn't have anything resembling a muffin. Knowing full well that ""muffin"" is a euphemism for ""cake for breakfast,"" I decided not to hide it—I developed a buttery, fruit-based cake that we serve in an elegant paper cup."

5019547~Wrap the piloncillo, Mexican brown sugar cones, in a kitchen towel and crush with a hammer to fine crumbs. If you can't find piloncillo, feel free to substitute packed dark brown sugar. Because coconut milk is not a dairy product, this delicious dessert is pareve.

5019568~This delicious stuffing is similar to a savory bread pudding. It's best baked alongside, rather than inside, the bird.

5019570~Head north of Sunset, and you will happen upon this live-music supper club tucked away in the hills of tony Bel Air. The swank venue features a stage surrounded by tables where you can spy toe-tapping regulars such as Nicolette Sheridan and Virginia Madsen taking in the soulful jazz tunes. You can make a meal of chef Sharon Funt's delicious flatbread appetizer; each serving provides more than 8 grams of fiber.
5019571~This recipe originally accompanied Ale-Battered Shrimp with Tartar Sauce .
5019572~Shawarma is the Middle Eastern version of a large vertical shish kebab known as doner kebab in Turkey and gyro in Greece. It's made by impaling layers of meat on an oversize spit with a flat base and roasting the meat in an upright rotisserie. There are at least three advantages to this singular method of cooking. The dripping fat bastes the meat below it; the meat is sliced to order (at least it should be) from the outside, which gives every customer a crusty end cut; and because the crusty meat slices are piled on pita bread with fresh vegetables, pickles, and tahini sauce, you get a whole meal—and a healthful one—in a single sandwich. Traditionally, shawarma was made with lamb, but more and more Israeli grill masters use thinly sliced chicken or turkey. Shawarma is easy to prepare if you have a vertical rotisserie, and somewhat more challenging to adapt to the home grill. But direct-grilling the turkey slices does give you a close approximation of the taste and texture of classic shawarma.
5019573~Complete this one with cherry tomatoes, potato chips, and lemonade.

5019581~My friend Marvin Woods taught me everything I know about Low-Country cooking, the regional cuisine commonly referred to as soul food. In many ways, soul food is an apt description because there is a lot of soul and spirit and passion that goes into Low-Country cooking—dishes like she-crab soup, catfish stew, shrimp and grits, red rice, hoppin' John, and baked macaroni and cheese. No Low-Country feast would be complete without corn bread.

5019604~Chang's two restaurants cater decidedly to the pork lover, and this salad is no exception. Among the sweet, smoky, and tart notes tossed together, you'll get an occasional zing of heat from the chili nuts (which, served on their own, may very well become your new favorite bar snack).
5019605~Crisp baguette slices are a natural with this, or serve the Rosemary Toasts, substituting tarragon for the rosemary. Either way, a salad of Boston lettuce and Belgian endive with lemon vinaigrette makes a lovely accompaniment, and a fruit tart is a good grand finale.
5019606~Refreshing and a little bit inebriating; if you've got kids running around, pick up a box of Rocket Pops so there's no confusion!

5019637~"""I've always loved to cook and bake,"" writes Gert Schwartz of Skokie, Illinois. ""When my husband worked for the kitchens of Sara Lee, I would bake about 2,000 cookies each Christmas to send to his coworkers. People thought it strange — sending coals to Newcastle — but at that time Sara Lee did not make cookies (I wasn't about to compete with the cheesecake operation), and everyone seemed to enjoy them. In your January 2001 issue, I read about the different cakes and had a desire to try the devil's food one, since my husband loves chocolate. I made the recipe as 24 cupcakes and decided to use a frosting recipe I have had since I was married, over 50 years ago. As a little girl, my favorite birthday cake was chocolate with white frosting, and when I took my first bite of your recipe, there I was: ten years old again. I thought you might like to have that frosting recipe."""

He was a picky eater and quite a challenge to cook for. He's married now with children of his own, and thankfully, he has learned to love almost everything I make. When we all get together, I like to do the cooking — it gives my daughter-in-law a break. And because most of my recipes are speedy, I still have time to enjoy my three grandchildren."""

5019659~Perfecting this recipe required a mother-daughter collaboration. My mom started it off by cutting the kernels off the cobs, simmering the corncobs in the stock, and then scraping the cobs to capture every ounce of delicious corn flavor. Her friend Darryle Pollack taught her the trick of including potatoes and blending part of the soup to thicken it. I added warming spices like paprika and cayenne pepper to complement the sweetness of the summer corn and topped it with charred red bell peppers. Together we created a perfect soup. —Marea

5019704~My mother came from a long line of New England women who cooked from scratch, but with four kids in the early 1950s, she quickly embraced canned cream of mushroom soup as the all-purpose binding sauce for casseroles, which were the backbone of her meal planning. Tuna noodle was the hands-down family favorite, which was a boon to my mother because she could make everyone happy with the contents of two cans (tuna and soup) and a partial box of egg noodles. When I'm feeling nostalgic, I make it for my own family. I have to admit I now prepare it with my own sauce, embellishing it with extra mushrooms and a little Sherry for flavor.

5019719~Foster's variation on a simple Tuscan classic might be considered heresy to purists, but our customers are crazy about the addition of olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach. It's a great dish for summer buffets. The salad can be made a day in advance; serve it lightly chilled or at room temperature.
5019720~In North India these legume wafers are called papad and are dry-roasted over a flame, but in the South they are deep-fried until they form lots of air bubbles and become light and puffy. They are sold in many flavors, but plain is preferred in Kerala. Pappadams are always part of a Sadhya: You crush one up and mix it together with rice, dhal, and ghee. The pappadam helps to bind all the ingredients together so you can form balls when eating with your hand. Store-bought wafers are used almost exclusively by Indian cooks because the traditional recipes are labor-intensive and require days of drying in the hot sun. This recipe is part of our menu for Sadhya, a South Indian feast.

5019729~Well, here it is, the bane of North Carolina barbecue. I don't know if it's the addition of mustard that brings frowns to the faces of North Carolina barbecue purists or the fact that this is a South Carolina sauce, but this sauce certainly illustrates the diverging tastes and traditions of barbecue in the Carolinas.

5019743~Chilies and corn—staples of the southwestern diet—are the hallmarks of this stuffing. Its intense corn flavor comes from a mixture of corn bread, corn chips, corn kernels and cream-style corn. It gets its zip from poblano and jalapeño chilies.

5019751~"Carey Paquette of Arlington, Virginia, writes: ""When it comes to cooking, I make an effort to prepare healthful meals, but wouldn't call myself a fanatic. I believe that olive oil goes in everything and wine goes with everything; I just use them in moderation."""
5019752~This is the ideal way to prepare young chickens, since there are two safeguards against their drying out (always a risk with small birds). The herbed butter slipped beneath the skin melts, basting and flavoring the meat as it cooks; the gentle, indirect heat lightly chars the skin without toughening the meat. As a result, every bite is juicy and perfectly seasoned.

5019757~These individual cakes, from Lantern pastry chef Monica Segovia-Welsh, are moist, tender, and not remotely fussy. If you dont want to fool with the suggested accompaniments, serve the cakes with a dollop of whipped cream instead.
5019758~Grapefruit zest stands in for lemon peel in the gremolata, an aromatic garnish.
5019759~The first Thanksgiving I took part in cooking was when I was 20, a college kid in Boston, living in a big, rambling house. The apartment was a kind of clubhouse devoted to a shifting list of priorities that included music, books, girls, beer, and food. On Thanksgiving we cooked a turkey. The recipe was my pal John Patrick Montaño's, and I still use it today: a roast bird glazed with a rosemary-infused teriyaki butter. The piney herb melds beautifully with the butter and sweet caramel of the mirin browning on lacquered skin. At once familiar and exotic, it results in flavor of astonishing depth.

5019781~Dates are revered, and much enjoyed, in Morocco. Of the more than two hundred varieties that the country produces, large mejhoul dates are the ones used for special occasions and special recipes like these stuffed dates. Typically, the almond paste is much sweeter than in this recipe, and the stuffed date is rolled in sugar. I prefer to let the dates' natural and intense sweetness shine.
5019782~Carrot cakes have been a part of American baking for years, and they remain a favorite dessert in the heartland. This version has a hint of orange from the juice and peel and lots of the rich cream cheese frosting that everyone expects (and loves). Thin orange peel strips make a pretty garnish.
5019783~Highly recommended!

5019790~I learned the joys of putting potatoes in bread during my time in the Napa Valley, so the flavors here are resonant of that magical place, but don't be afraid to change up the herbs or play with nuts and olives. You can't mess it up. Well, you can—I certainly have more than once—but you know what I mean. You can do this by hand, but it's messy, so I wrote this recipe with directions for using a stand mixer. —Duff

5019804~Brisket really  gets Jews talking. The mere mention of the word brings up stories of holidays past, aunts who can’t cook, aunts who can cook, grandmas force-feeding grandkids, etc. While beef was often very expensive in the old country, brisket became a symbol of plenty in North America, where it was more affordable but no less special. This brisket is braised for hours, just as many Jewish briskets are, but we incorporate white wine instead of the more typical red, and butternut squash instead of potatoes. This makes for a lighter, brighter brisket, if such a thing exists, so it’s a better fit for holiday meals served during the warmer months. Note that the second cut brisket we recommend for this recipe will not slice as thinly as the first cut. It’s softer and fattier. This doesn’t bother us. The meat will be so tender you could cut it with a spoon—who needs a thin slice? Also note that if you’d like to make this a more wintry brisket, you can swap the squash for potatoes and/or turnips and put the veggies in an hour earlier than the recipe calls for. Jeffrey prefers it that way, and once again, we agree to disagree.

5019832~We love mashed potatoes in every way possible, but we're extremely partial to this incarnation paired with cauliflower.

5019850~Neal Fraser, Executive Chef and co-owner of Grace and BLD in Los Angeles, shared the recipe for this elegant pasta dish with Epicurious: Fresh pasta shells are tossed with lobster, peas, rich Mascarpone cheese, and fresh herbs. It's one of the best-selling dishes at Grace. It's best to use fresh or thawed, frozen cavatelli, which the sauce will really cling to, but other fresh pasta shells or, in a pinch, dried pasta could be substituted.

5019860~"Susan Richardson of Edina, Minnesota, writes: ""My mother worked full-time when I was growing up, so as the oldest daughter in a family of six children, I did a lot of cooking. From the time I was seven years old, my mom taught me how to cook and bake — salad, bread, vegetables, and dessert were pretty much part of every dinner. Even today, I make it a point to prepare and eat dinner with my two teenage children. Though we're very busy, we'll never abandon our dinner ritual. It's the time when we can talk and reconnect."""
5019861~Asparagus or peas may be added to this recipe. Gremolata—a mixture of lemon zest, garlic, and parsley typically sprinkled over osso buco (braised veal shank)—is not traditionally used in Italian Jewish vegetable dishes, but it gives this one lightness and sparkle.

5019865~"Dr. James Henry Salisbury might have been the first of the protein-diet doctors, proclaiming in 1888 that humankind's maladies were caused by too much starchy food. His solution? Chopped lean meat, or hamburger steak. To hide the ""liver-y"" taste of hamburger, he recommended adding horseradish, mustard or Worcestershire sauce. By the 1900s, Salisbury steak was a staple menu item, often served with mushroom gravy or smothered in onions. This version, inspired by today’s southwestern cooking, has terrific flavor."
5019866~No need to peel the peaches — the peel provides great color, texture, and flavor. Just gently rub off the peach fuzz with a kitchen towel.

5019939~Robert H. Cobb, owner of the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood, is said to have invented this salad in the 1930s as a late-night snack for himself.

And it is beautiful to boot.

5019947~This recipe is based on a delicious dish made by Laura DaMiano, a Quebecois chef. She loves the flavor of butternut squash paired with Oka cheese, a mild, semisoft cow's-milk cheese. Mild Cheddar can be used as a substitute. If you are making this entire menu in a single oven, and you are not making the scalloped squash ahead, you can bake the squash while the ham is standing after braising.

5019958~Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
5019959~Making moussaka is something of an undertaking—a rich meat sauce (made here with lamb, but you can substitute other ground meats such as turkey, veal, or even pork, if you prefer), layered with tender eggplant and a cheese sauce. You can make the moussaka in two smaller casserole dishes to serve one now and freeze one to bake later.

5019961~Highly recommended!
5019962~If there were just one stock I'd encourage you to make, this is it. Why? Because it is the foundation of more soups and sauces than any other stock I use.

5019973~These superfood-filled, protein-packed bites are perfect for a pre-workout boost or mid-day recharge. If you're sensitive to caffeine or will be serving kids, feel free to skip the chocolate-coffee coating.
5019974~An aromatic broth of garlic, scallions, and ginger infuses the fish and helps keep it incredibly moist.
5019975~Highly recommended!
5019976~Asiago frico — easy-to-make crispy cheese wafers — top this salad. Look for tender young spinach at the farmers' market. In some areas, what you find at the farmers' market may be cheaper than what's available at the supermarket. If you have a first-rate extra-virgin olive oil and some sea salt in your cupboard, here's a chance to show them off.
5019977~Offer this elegant dish with a sauté of vegetables.
5019978~Highly recommended!
5019979~This recipe was created to accompany Fillet Mignons on Jerusalem Artichoke Purée .

5019981~Mango chutney and habañero chili spike this fantastic sauce.
5019982~Chill this overnight to develop the blueberry flavor and give the filling time to set.
5019983~Sweet tea never tasted so good—especially for those bent on unwinding after a long workweek. Try it with a lunch of fried chicken and deviled eggs and see if you don't agree.
5019984~For this holiday-worthy recipe, roasting the butternut with several bay leaves slipped between the slices results in a subtle aromatic backdrop for the chile glaze.
5019985~"Bruce Aidells, founder of Aidell's Sausage Company, says, ""When I was in college, a friend from Mississippi introduced me to the technique of marinating the turkey by rubbing the meat under the skin with flavorings. Over the years, I've continued to modify the recipe for what I refer to as 'trash bag turkey,' so named because a large plastic bag is the best thing for holding the bird while it marinates for a day or two."""
5019986~Highly recommended!
5019987~For this juicy, herbaceous salad, feel free to combine different varieties of cucumbers and tomatoes, which are at peak season around the same time.
5019988~Ginger and Shaoxing rice wine give a deep, round intensity to chicken, turning it into something sumptuous. The salty savor of country ham and chewy, dense chestnuts help make each forkful a hit.
5019989~Highly recommended!
5019990~This simple dish employs the French technique of cooking vegetables in a mixture of water and butter. The water eventually cooks out after steaming the vegetables, leaving them glazed with the butter. This is a dish that can be cooked while the turkey is resting.
5019991~This traditional, tasty drink has 200 fewer calories than a margarita. Olé!
5019992~Highly recommended!

5019996~"""Many of the everyday dishes I made when I was raising my daughters are recipes I learned from my mother while I was growing up in the suburbs of Paris,"" writes Fanny Carroll of Eugene, Oregon.

5020002~A light dessert that is made extra easy by the use of purchased fruit juice. No ice cream maker required.
5020003~Of all soufflés, this is my favorite. The enticing aroma of goat cheese is very seductive, and the little pockets of melted cheese are found treasures. Although a classic soufflé dish forms a high, puffed crown, I often bake this and other soufflés in a large shallow gratin dish instead. It still looks marvelous, it bakes more quickly, and this way there's plenty of crust for everyone.
5020004~Highly recommended!
5020005~No Thanksgiving dinner would be complete without cranberry relish. It can be made in large batches if you want to make enough for the winter.
5020006~This recipe is intended as a baked dressing to accompany the Thanksgiving turkey . It can be used as stuffing (a practice I do not recommend for turkey), if you desire. It also makes a good stuffing for capon or pork.
5020007~Fresh compote replaces cream-and-egg-laden pie filling.
5020008~Parbaking the crust of this blueberry pancake–flavored custard pie ensures the bottom will be crisp when it’s done.
5020009~Fish deserve some salty foreplay just as much as pork and poultry. Every type of seafood is different in terms of density of the flesh, so different brine times are needed for different fish.
5020010~"Rachel English of Atlanta, Georgia, writes: ""My husband and I both love to cook (and eat), so we were excited when we heard that local chef Kevin Rathbun was opening a new restaurant, called Rathbun's, not too far from our house. We stopped by for dinner a few weeks ago and absolutely loved the fried shrimp appetizer. I just have to have the recipe."""

5020016~Highly recommended!
5020017~"These ""gnocchi"" are more like baked polenta cutouts. For a pretty presentation, cut the gnocchi with a three-inch-square scalloped cookie cutter."

5020020~Gamberi Aragonati
5020021~The flat cut of brisket is leaner than the point cut (or deckle) but still has enough fat to keep it juicy. It will hold its shape better as it cooks, and slices neatly.
5020022~The ricotta needs to chill for about two hours. Consider making it the night before so the ricotta is ready to go when you assemble the carpaccio.
5020023~Highly recommended!

5020030~This recipe is an accompaniment for Braised Pork with Mojo Sauce .
5020031~This hot chicken casserole is perfectly seasoned. Lots of celery and almonds give it a nice crunch. You may be inclined to leave off the potato-chip topping, but believe me, it won't be the same without it!
5020032~You thought chocolate was good? Try chocolate with cherries and pistachios. Heaven!
5020033~We used grocery rotisserie chickens for this recipe, but leftover turkey from the holiday table works equally well.
5020034~All the flavors of chicken pot pie, but handheld!
5020035~Highly recommended!
5020036~Highly recommended!
5020037~This cornbread is a little firmer and denser than one made for eating on its own so that it will hold up to grilling and tossing with the dressing for the Grilled Cornbread Salad with Red Onions, Arugula, and Red Wine Vinaigrette.
5020038~The pleasingly chewy biscotti are coated on one end with white chocolate. In our test kitchen, imported white chocolate, such as Perugina or Lindt, yielded the best results.
5020039~High-heat roasting concentrates vegetables' flavor and brings out their sweetness— a big reward for little effort. Use this recipe as a template. Most important: Cut into similar-size pieces, and don't overcrowd the pan.
5020040~Highly recommended!

5020043~Editor's note: The recipe and introductory text below are from A Baker's Odyssey by Greg Patent.

5020062~Highly recommended!
5020063~The all-purpose side: It goes with the lamb, the chicken, the lobster, and anything else you're grilling this summer.
5020064~Look for tender greens, such as mâche, Boston, and red leaf lettuces, which appear in farmers' markets at this time of year. Or, as an alternative, use premixed baby greens.
5020065~Beautifully bright green, this herbaceous oil really enhances the anise flavor in the lobster gelées.
5020066~Timing note: You'll need to start this recipe two days ahead.
5020067~The grill adds a sophisticated smoky quality to this dish, but you can make it from beginning to end using only the oven.

5020074~Fluffy texture (thanks to less-starchy converted rice) and the right balance of flavors (bay, thyme, and white pepper) earn this foolproof rice its name.
5020075~Serve additional pear crisps as snacks.
5020076~It's the classic brunch dish—in salad form. Frisée, edamame, radishes, and red onions are sprinkled with prosciutto, then topped with a poached egg and hollandaise.
5020077~Menashe advises against overstuffing the onions with the filling; the rice expands, gradually increasing the size of the onions as they cook. Feel free to swap in ground beef for the lamb.
5020078~Mixing sorrel with spinach makes an outstanding spanakopita, but the combination is nothing new. The Greeks have been doing it for a long time and it makes a lot of sense. The distinctive tang of sorrel not only replaces the lemon juice often found in spinach fillings for spanakopita, but it also balances the brininess of the feta.

5020080~This recipe is part of our Spring Grocery Bag Menu featuring 5 easy weeknight dinners made from 1 grocery bag of ingredients.
5020081~Serve these mussels with a frisée salad dressed with red wine vinaigrette. Add french fries, plus a baguette for sopping up the sauce. Lemon tart would be good for dessert.
5020082~I love using baby carrots in assorted colors. Thumbelina carrots, which are little and stubby, are great for roasting. I use red, orange, yellow, and white carrots for the ribbons, which make this salad so vibrant. Even just the orange variety next to the green of the avocado and mizuna makes a beautiful and colorful salad. Toasting whole cumin seeds and then grinding them in a mortar and pestle or an electric spice grinder is essential for the great taste of this vinaigrette. If you don't have either way of grinding spices, you can substitute cumin powder. This salad rocks from the contrast between the soft texture and caramelized sweetness of the roasted carrots and their raw and crunchy counterparts.
5020083~Thyme really shines in this soup; sautéed apples are an interesting sweet garnish.
5020084~Chef Beverly Gannon accompanies the bread with this salsa, plus a garlic-ginger yogurt dipping sauce and a tomato-mint sauce.
5020085~We love the frilly edges of olive oil-fried eggs. Serve them over chickpeas for a vegetarian main.

5020098~The leftover cooking liquid makes the perfect base for a soup or white sauce.
5020099~Maple syrup brings out the subtle sweetness of the bacon. If you like, you can substitute molasses (not blackstrap).
5020100~My brother, Al, is an inspiring teacher at Jamie Oliver's cooking school, Recipease. This is an adaptation of one of his favorite recipes to enjoy at home. For a wonderful spring stew, try adding some blanched asparagus, peas, and beans, or top it with a crust for a comforting pie .

5020110~Although labeled fully cooked, the ham will still need a gentle baking for maximum tenderness and flavor. Be sure the Cranberry Mustard and the Whole Wheat Date Rolls are close at hand and that the ham is sliced thin for those who would like to make small sandwiches.
